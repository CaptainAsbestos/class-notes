## Arab Spring: The Politics of Protest, Chance, or No-Change

It could argue either how things have changed for the good or how they have deteriorated or how they have not changed one way or another. Pick a country and argue the case since 2011. You will need a lot of evidence to support your thesis and neutralise counter-arguments. Argue what the uprising was about across the region as well as within the country of choice. Secondly, show how precarious the pre-2011 status quo was and why the protestors chose to protest -- and why wars broke out where they did. Finally, describe what your topic country got out of the events and weigh whether the outcome was "worth" the cost. Title your paper as the essay prompt. 

## Modernisation

In the past half-century, MENA societies have gone through immense modernisation, state-directed and otherwise. How would you characterise the effects of modernisation in the region: very good, mainly good, not that good, or somewhat detrimental? Discuss making sure that you define modernisation and demonstrate how it has affected MENA societies and why you consider the effects to be what you say.

## Islamism

Are Islamist and religious parties like the Muslim Bros. or others more influential than secular parties in MENA? If so, why? If not, why?

## Two-State Solution in Israel-Palestine

Is the two-state solution possible anymore? Does Israel bear the blame? Why or why not? Use concrete and logical reasoning, supported by facts, to argue your case. Do not just repeat what we have discussed in class.
