## Three dimensions of inclusion/exclusion in populist movements

This will be really helpful for bolivia/peru comparison

1. material / economic: The "pure people" are defined by their exclusion from wealth (chavismo). Canovan's "ordinary" people
2. political: exclusion from the franchise or from contestation (indigenous populism, ANC in SA) "United People"
3. symbolic / sociocultural: cultural identity groups excluded from society, if not politics, or ethnonationalist groups. Canovan's "Ethnic Kin of people"
