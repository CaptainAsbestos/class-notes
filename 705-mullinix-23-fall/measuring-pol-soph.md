# Measuring Political Sophistication

## Author: Robert C. Luskin; reviewed by Alex Horne

Luskin, R. C. (1987). Measuring political sophistication. American journal of political science, 856-899.

In my research, I'm interested in seeing what effect political sophistication has on many topics, particularly threat perceptions towards nationalism at home and abroad. Thus, it's my independent variable, and threat perceptions are the dependent. 

## 1: Topic \& Purpose

Writing in 1987, Luskin presents an overview of the state of the literature on this concept. Why? First, it's a widely used and studied concept, but he's wary that social scientists may not actually be measuring what they think they are measuring. Second, he has his own suggestions for how to measure the concept in further research. 

## 2A: Theory

Luskin begins by talking about cognitive psychology. Sophistication is "a matter of cognition" – it takes place in the brain. Cognitions are "memory, the words in the grammar of thought."  These elementary components are connected through "associations," meaning "beliefs and attitudes." Paraphrasing Scott in 1963, he writes that (with respect to cognitive bits), "the distinction between content and structure is not absolute." These associations between cognitive bits "need only make sense to the person whose cognitions they are." In other words, when it's all in someone's head, the thoughts they think and the stored ideas they have only have to be interpretable to the thinker. To use an analogy, bad handwriting is only bad if the original scribe can't read it later. 

Next, he defines a *political belief system* (PBS) as "a person's political cognitions, together with those with which they are constrained [associated/organised]." In plain English, a PBS is what someone thinks and how they connect their thoughts to one another. These thoughts remain in Hard-disk storage rather than Rapid-Access Memory. The more central a thought is, the more likely it is to be connected to many other thoughts. A more central thought will be used more often; an oft-used and well-connect cognition, therefore, has the most meaning to its thinker. 

Thus, he conceives of three variable dimensions on which to plot a person's political sophistication: size, range, and organisation. The more topics you know about, the more sophisticated you are. The deeper your knowledge, likewise; the more interconnected your thoughts are, likewise. "A person is politically sophisticated to the extent to which his or her PBS is large, wide-ranging, and highly constrained." This is helpful because each dimension is easier to measure on their own; we can therefore think of sophistication as a composite index of the three. 

Luskin enumerates thirteen points which he wishes to stress, and I paraphrase them here:

1. The organisational dimension ≠ consistency, either within someone's PBS or between a group of individuals.
2. "We should hardly regard a person who holds a small handful of cognitions about each of a small handful of political topics as politically sophisticated, however interwoven those cognitions might be."
3. The three dimensions are related, which could cause some issues with measurement. Causality between them is reciprocal and mutual. 
4. Political sophistication, as he understands it, is identical to "political expertise" as other researchers call it.
5. "A person can be politically sophisticated without making much use of such high-order abstractions as 'liberal' and 'conservative' and can be unsophisticated despite using them." Call it the "Dunning Krueger effect" applied. The more abstract a cognition is, the more centrally connected and often used it is likely to be -- therefore, abstract cognitions are probably the most meaningful to the thinker. 
6. Ideology is just a "particularly sophisticated PBS."
7. Just because someone uses the abstract labels to define their PBS doesn't mean it necessarily crosses the (arbitrary) threshold into "ideology" territory.
8. Ideologies are necessarily comprehensive. "An ideology runs more or less the gamut of political affairs or it is *not* an ideology [emphasis mine]." Other labels might suit this better, such as "opinions, views and ideas."[^1]
9. "All ideologies are conceptual and informational.... All involved affect and have behavioral consequences."
10. Sophisticated PBSes show greater differentiation and greater integration.
11. "Sophistication is a matter of how much and how a person thinks about politics, not what." The opposite of sophistication is ignorance. 
12. "Sophistication is not the same as rationality."
13. "Issue oritentation too is a separate variable.... a person may care passionately about some issue(s) and act accordingly without being particularly sophisticated."

[^1]: EG, the label "gender ideology" which some right-wingers use to smear the teaching of LGBT existence, let alone tolerance, in elementary schools. By Luskin's criterion, this is a misues of the term "ideology," because teaching about these issues is not a comprehensive belief system. No surprises there. 

## 2B: Measuring the Variable

Having explained sophistication as a concept, Luskin now turns to how others have operationalised it. By its very nature as cognition, we can only infer sophistication (as opposed to something like Income, which we can directly measure). Implied but not stated is that sophistication varies in individuals or communities from complete ignorance to perfect expertise. Luskin doesn't address this point.

There are three broad categories of measurement which Luskin surveys: 1) consistency; 2) abstraction; 3) information holding. A fourth category is simply a composite measure of pairs or all three.

The first method he discusses is to examine the consistency of a person's beliefs across a battery of issues – the more consistent they are, the more they are cognitively connected and therefore we can say this person would be "politically sophisticated." I disagree with this operationalisation, for reasons discussed later; luckily Luskin has reasons to agree with me. First, consistency only captures the sophistication of the top most knowledgeable members of a studied population anyway (cf. Bennett et alia 1979 and Rapoport 1979). Secondly, the correlation between sophistication and consistency is itself weak because it reflects "constraint-sharing," "question form," "question content," and "external association." To synthesise these four shortcomings, humans living in society take cues from one another, borrow each others' thinking, devote more time to pondering important political struggles, and can be primed to respond one way or another by framing.  

Alternate methods of consistency include gauging how accurately and precisely people match their stated beliefs to the labels they employ (self-location) or measuring the nonuniformity of a subject's PBS rather than its uniformity (entropy). Luskin dismisses both as coming up short. Self-location suffers from question form and content problems still; entropy can be influenced by sociodemographic group and not just the subject's sophistication because many beliefs have their origins in both cognition *and* experience. 

The second method Luskin covers is measuring abstraction. "Constraint, in large degree, is abstraction" – the organisation of associated thoughts should theoretically correlate with how abstracted from hard facts they are. A person fluent in abstract terminology (not necessarily jargon) is sophisticated; one employing abstract lines of argument is likewise sophisticated. Because the other two dimensions are mutually causative with abstraction, this makes a decent measure.

Luskin explains his own method for measuring sophistication as abstraction on page 880 of my copy. He ranks subjects on a 17-point scale, "the number of times he or she correctly locates 'liberals' and 'conservatives' on the 'government guarantee of jobs and living standard' and 'reducing crime versus protecting the rights of the accused' scales, where the correct answer put liberals on the interventionist side and 'conservatives' on the laissez-faire side of the first and 'conservatives' closer to the 'reducing crime' pole of the second." This raise a number of red flags for me, namely that this only makes sense in the local context of the US in the '80s (see my later critique for more elaboration on this shortcoming). All this really measures is how people think about the labels liberal and conservative, which doesn't demonstrate much at all about their understanding of those two labels. Liberalism as an ideology is not very clear cut on the issues presented to subjects (did I mention that these are only two topics as well?). There's a whole other segment of the ideological spectrum that should be included for any research in the 2020s, incorporating subject's response to left-of-liberal policy positions. I say this because self-described liberal policy-makers would not necessarily, even in the 1980s, argue for a jobs guarantee or soft-on-crime legislation. Maybe I should ask someone who lived through this era first-hand if Luskin's method was appropriate for the time. In addition, he also uses post-interview questions about partisan control of Congress and a subjective assessment of the respondent's sophistication (wow!).

The third method group which Luskin discusses includes the researchers measuring information holding.

At this point I wish to enumerate a few variables I think will be necessary in any study measuring sophistication. I'd want to account for the role intelligence plays; from my anecdotal experience, unintelligent people can slowly acquire sophistication with enough practice (I would probably include myself here!). Luckily, Luskin's model helps explain how sophistication varies over time – use and disuse affect how central any thought or network of thoughts is at any moment. But still, I think that it's important to consider what role intelligence plays in one's ability to demonstrate sophistication.

## 3: Distributional Implications, or His Findings 

"Whither Sophistication Research?" asks Luskin at the end. I wonder the same. 

## Discussion 

The problem with sophistication as a variable is that I'll probably have to rely on relative sophistication between survey respondents but also prepare the extreme ends of "utterly ignorant" and "complete expert." How does one establish the floor and ceiling in a survey? I didn't get the answers for which I had hoped from Luskin, so more research is necessary. 

I mentioned I had reservations towards using consistency as a measure for sophistication. While Luskin draws a clear line between false consciousness and ignorance, I'm not so sure that he's correct to do so. Falsely conscious people, insofar as these two concepts are distinguishable, would have intense beliefs about certain issue areas but not realise that their deeply held convictions may have a logical conflict with another.

As an example: a hypothetical working class voter who implicitly understands the labour theory of value, knowing that his or her job is essential for the function of her workplace, but not recognising the logical consequences which this implies for the rest of society and the market economy. I imagine Luskin would counterargue that this person scores low on political sophistication, and that I'm missing the point... or that this person has other contextual reasons for not recognising the contradiction. But still, it seems to me that sophistication isn't really related to anything meaningful (or at least, not related to what I want to measure). 

I question whether consistency can be assessed objectively; what makes a set of values consistent is the meaning ascribed to that category by a coder in a specific cultural context. Using consistency to measure sophistication means that we would also *necessarily* code some comprehensive ideologies as self-inconsistent (Adam Tooze openly talks about his own left-liberalism as grappling with the apparent contradictions in his ideology in [this interview](https://www.americanprestigepod.com/p/bonus-tooze-day-w-adam-tooze#details), and I think he's right to admit this point). It seems to me that any researcher conducting a questionnaire has to decide what the minimum threshold of consistency in a world where all ideologies encounter contradictions as they expand to full comprehension. PBSes either ignore such cases as irrelevant (exceptions proving rules), create adhoc explanations which are incompatible with larger theory, or are simply unaware that contradicting cases exist.

Perhaps I would be better served by looking into whether any serious attempt has been made to operationalise false consciousness and study it, or whether researchers have dropped the concept in favour of a more useful yet similar variable. 

Generally, I wonder if political socialisation after the Information Revolution of the internet has any bearing on sophistication. Too late now, but I wonder what correlations may exist between average time spent on the internet and sophistication. By Luskin's strict definition, you'd expect terminally online cranks to be as sophisticated as a well-informed activist, but I don't think he accounted for the role misinformation plays in PBS consolidation. Are conspiracy theorists politically sophisticated? He offers Birchers and Trotskyists as examples of "equivalently sophisticated" but come on. I hope someone else as addressed this.

A counter-argument against this point which I can already imagine goes as follows:  conspiracy theorists are an extreme minority of the population, so it's unlikely to affect the quality of your data much. Odds are that they aren't terribly articulate in their opinions either. Luskin himself writes that "sophistication and articulateness should rarely keep company." All this is probably true, but for my interests in right wing nationalism, coming up against conspiracy theory and demographic edge cases is unavoidable. 

Another issue with Luskin's work is that it's external validity is tenuous. Perhaps things have changed since publication, but it sounds like most surveys on political sophistication have to deal with domestic politics. Maybe sophistication plays out differently in different domains of knowledge? (doubtful!) Me personally, I want to see if there's a mismatch between political sophistication on domestic topics and international ones. My hunch is that most people people are slightly more sophisticated on the domestic level. But this isn't to say they aren't sophisticated on international topics; the relative difference simply favours the domestic. I also think that accuracy of political knowledge should be disaggregated from intensity of political opinion -- it seems to me that Luskin views these two qualities as poles of the same variable. I think that's problematic.

## Where I go from here

I definitely need to follow up ion Field and Anderson's study of voters in the 1960s and their ideologies – particularly in any work responding to their conclusions.
