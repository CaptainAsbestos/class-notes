# Intro to International Relations

## The State vs. The Government

- Who is the *demos*
- What is a *res publica*
- L'etat c'est moi -- the state and the monarch were fused
    * the king's domain was a legal extension of his personhood -- Sovereign
    * Serfs were had little legal personhood outside their relation to the land they inhabited
- Prime Minister vs. Head-of-State
- What is Sovereignty?
- What is legitimacy

## Nations

- The Italian Wars and 100 years wars created national identities -- it meant something to be "french"

## The Origins of the International System

- States dominate the international system because they are hard to dislodge
- Stateless societies have existed but societies governed by states seem to enjoy a real advantage

## Machiavelli \& Hobbes

- Machiavelli: Advice for princes
- Hobbes: Advice for subjects
- Mac was a practitioner of politics, not a theorist (louis 11th of france too). Exiled from Florence b/c he pissed off the Medici
- He observed that leaders who sought to govern "ethically" and "do the right thing" usually ended up dead, and their na√Øvete got lots of other people pointlessly killed
- Instead, Mac proposed that the actual key to success was "learning not to be good"
- Power is the actual variable determining how well a politician will be remembered
- Types of Power:
    * Persuasion: Charisma, debate, bribery
    * Dissuasion: Threats or Violence
    * Learning what tools the moment calls for is essential to success
- Question: How many of Machiavelli's assumptions are primordial and how many arose from the simple facts of life in renaissance italy (ie constructed)
- Do the ends justify the means? 

- Hobbes gave advice for subjects
- Experienced the English Civil War first-hand -- how does that shape his perspective?
- Argued that citizens should prostrate themselves before the State (known as a Leviathan) because Disorder was worse than tyranny
