Thomson writes that four major political ideologies have significant influence in modern African politics: Nationalism, socialism, state capitalism, and populism. Nationalism is a prevalent sentiment in every African state, but these nations are unique in that their identities were retconned after the fact from artificial borders containing multi-ethnic populations. He subdivides socialism into Orthodox Marxism and Socialism with African characteristics; the scientific socialists hewed closer to the Leninist model of industrial development but African socialist countries preferred to synthesise traditional values with the goal of economic modernisation. State capitalist countries also pursued state-led development but explicitly sought engagement with the global capitalist system. Lastly, populism is the ideology of states which seek to address the needs of the poor and marginalised in their societies through policy but shirk a doctrinaire approach. He variously describes states such as Gaddafist Libya and Burkina Faso under Sankara as populist regimes. He makes no mention of either Arab Socialism or Arab nationalism.

The case study for this chapter examines Tanzania's attempt to realise economic development through African socialist policies. Nyerere stipulated that Socialist theory did not end with Marx and that it ought to adapted to conditions in Tanzania. Furthermore, he argued that pre-colonial society closely resembled the classless state which is the ultimate end of Communism, and thus modern methods should be used to return to that state. Through *ujamaa* policies of collectivised agriculture and state-funded welfare, Tanzania could avoid the pitfalls of capitalist development and avoid the creation of a \`bureacratic\' bourgeoisie.

Like in other peasant societies which attempted agricultural reforms, the program encountered difficulties when trying to collectivise farms. Peasants, who care more about self-sustainability, did not prioritise their work on the collective farms, meaning that Tanzania was unable to match its population growth with growth in the grain supply. This failure to offer peasants a significant buy-in for the success of collective farms was exacerbated by bad agricultural policies, such as growing the wrong crop in the wrong places and lack of transportation infrastructure. In frustration, local leaders often resorted to authoritarian management reminiscent of the colonisers, a practice which undermined the rhetoric which Nyerere employed and harmed the people they were supposed to serve. 

Thomson warns against writing off the *ujamaa* program as a complete failure, however: free, universal education and access to medical treatment were incentives to join the collective farms. These policies demonstrably improved life expectancy and literacy in Tanzania, something the former colonisers had neglected. After the program was rolled back to comply with international demands for structural readjustment, both quality of life and education levels have fallen as the state schools and clinics were closed.
