## Foreign Policy, *Failed State Index* (2009)

The authors write that failed states are those which are unable to protect their citizens from violent conflict or provide the social institutions necessary for ordinary life. They ask what should be done by leading states in the global North to reduce the misery which inhabitants of failed states face. 

The index in 2009 is the fifth such, relying on 12 indicators of solvency and competency. The 60 worst scoring on the index are deserving special attention. They also draw a distinction between weak states and weak countries -- often, a strong state can preside over a failing society (puzzlingly, they use Iran as an example of this). Not all failed states present systemic threats to the entire world; indeed, some are so far-gone that al-Qaeda chose to leave. 

## Kaplan, *the Remarkable Story of Somaliland*, (2008)

Ironically, non-recognition of Somaliland may have been why it has proven to be the exception to the violence which surrounds it: Somalilanders have to turn to each other for assistance, since there is no expectation that international help is on the way (since it would all arrive through intermediation in Mogadishu). Therefore, people in the North work in solidarity with others, even when disputes arise. 

Additionally, Somaliland was colonised by the British, who preferred indirect rule, whereas the south of Somalia was colonised directly by the Italians, who preferred to demolish the traditional repositories of authority and administer the colony directly. These divergent paths began a century ago, and the artificial border between the two remained a wedge throughout the independence period and lead-up to the secession war. 

Kaplan describes the Northern state as non-Westphalian, in that its legitimacy derives from sources only found in the local culture and not European notions of statehood, sovereignty, and legitimacy. The north is still not a great place for women, for example, but neither is the south; at least in the North, violence is under control and women feel confident that police can and will prosecute criminals. Clan identities still structure society, but in Somaliland elders mediate conflicts before they get out of hand; compare this to the south, where clan divisions are the organising lines of entire militias. 

The relationship between the state and civil society is close in Somaliland, but rather than the state smothering its citizens, the closeness ensures government accountability. In contrast to the approach of other nationalist movements in Africa, traditional authority was not undermined but indeed made a planned-component of the state. This leads to snags of their own: women are excluded from the political process, and nepotism overrides merit in bureaucratic appointments. But institutionalised clannism is one diverging point which Kaplan points to in explaining the peace of Somaliland. 

All of this has been achieved without international recognition, but that is not to say that such recognition isn't needed. Sovereign states enjoy African Union representation, international drawing rights, and so on, and Somaliland has had to make do without. Kaplan argues that the breakaway territory *should* be recognised internationally, both to acknowledge their control of their territory, and to maybe serve as an example of good governance being rewarded. Indeed, it was a separate country before confederation with the south, and other countries in Africa have seceded and been recognised despite devolving into violence. The main obstacles outside of academia to recognition are Ethiopia and Djibouti, who prefer to see an insolvent Somalian state which cannot compete with them; outside of the Horn of Africa, Arab states are resolutely anti-recognition, and Western nations prefer to see Somaliland's status as an "internal" matter. 

Kaplan cautions that elections do not a democracy make. Democratic institutions and culture must be inclusive, competent, and accountable to be meaningful, and the ways to make them so are unique to each society. He also warns that sending in bundles of aid money may only alienate a state from its citizens: 

> Helping underdeveloped countries should not be about propping up the state from outside but rather about connecting it -- and making it accountable where possible -- to its surrounding society. (260)

Secondly, ethnic cohesiveness (which is different from homogeneity) can make a peaceful society more possible. In societies with two or three predominant ethnicities, competition for scarce resources can result in a "winner takes all" mentality; Somalilanders' struggle for recognition creates solidarity which avoids this pitfall. (This raises a concerning question: should governments continue to recognise failed states? Wouldn't the loss of recognition incentivise national sovereignty?)

Third, Kaplan writes that institutional design (including clans as an instrument of governance) has also been key to Somaliland's success at state-building. This may have been possible without secession, but, again, it is not guaranteed. At the very least Kaplan argues that federation, not centralisation, should be considered as a solution. Most importantly, designing a new constitution should be a local-generated, organic process, not imposed from without by political scientists.

## Menkhaus, *Governance with Government in Somalia* 

Where Kaplan focuses on the success of the north, Menkhaus is writing about the failure of statebuilding, peacebuilding, and other international initiatives in the south. Unique to the south is that it has been stateless for so long, meaning that the inertia of lawlessness is deeply entrenched. Despite having the deck stacked against them, Menkhaus writes that there have been local successes at governance-building without a government.

Communities are never passive when anarchy erupts in failed states. They always seek to recreate the structures of collective security and basic governance in the absence of a state; sometimes they succeed, sometimes they fail, in varying degrees, owing to a many variables.
