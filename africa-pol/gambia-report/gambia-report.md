The Gambia is geographically unique among African states. Its territory is the smallest of the Continental countries and is surrounded on three sides by a Senegal and by the Atlantic Ocean on its fourth. This is a legacy of a slavery; the British Empire laid claim to the mouth of the River Gambia and its watershed, having no serious economic interests beyond human trafficking. The surrounding area, present day Senegal, was controlled by the French. The imposition of alien borders on this region are undeniably helpful in explaining the divergent paths of the two states but also present an obstacle to their political and economic development. Despite its size, the Gambia is one of the most densely populated countries in Africa. 61% of its 2.5 million inhabitants are concentrated in urban areas, particularly at the mouth of the river in the area around the Capital Banjul. While the Gambia is geographically unique, its political problems are emblematic of the challenges which African states have faced throughout modern history.

## The Second Inheritance

During the first few decades of its independence, the Gambia inherited the political challenges of European Colonialism; since 2016, it now inherits the aftermath of a decades long dictatorship which undermines its position West African politics. 

The Gambia under the People's Progressive Party was a typical African nationalist state with a presidential system. After a decade of state involvement in the economy, the state had undertaken structural adjustment programs in the 1980s to curb inflation and reduce its debt arrears. In tandem with the SAP came corruption scandals, declining standards of living, and a failed coup attempt in 1981.

In 1994, a mutiny in the army over wages escalated into a bloodless coup d'etat which deposed the PPP government. Foreign aid from the United States and Britain was suspended as Dawda Jawara's PPP government fled to Dakar. Yahya Jammeh was a junior officer who proved instrumental in the coup taking the capital, and in the years after rose through the ranks to become the leader of the military regime. Once in charge, Jammeh denounced "neocolonialism" as the source of the country's problems and withdrew from the Commonwealth of Nations. He reorganised the constitution to consolidate power in the presidency and promoted loyalists within the military, elevating members of his Jola ethnicity over others. 

The Jammeh regime, against all apparent sense, attempted to become economically autarkic and politically independent throughout the '90s. During the Jammeh period, economic growth stagnated while the population continued to grow; to smooth over these pains, the Gambia borrowed and spent rather than investing. The problem was that the Gambia is entirely dependent on either Senegal or maritime exports for foreign trade and development. Its domestic market was too small to sustain an economy of scale in many industries; additionally, there were no existing industries in which the Gambia wielded a competitive advantage over Senegal, which has virtually identical (but greater) natural endowments. Dependent as it is on primary products, such as cotton, ground-nuts, and agriculture, Gambian production added little value within the supply chain and faced protectionist policies from developed countries against its exports. In recognition of this fact and others, Senegambian confederation made a great deal of sense when it was first attempted: eliminating an obviously pointless border could have been a boon to both countries. But after decades of mismanagement and human rights abuses under Jammeh, it is doubtful that the Senegalese would want to merge with the Gambia and make the Gambia's political problems *their own* problems.

Nevertheless, the Gambia is a founding member of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in 1975 and is part of the West African Monetary Zone formed in 2000. Hopefully economic integration with nearby countries will facilitate development, but introduction of the zone's planned common currency, the "Eco", is still a years off. The immediate political situation in the Gambia is responding not to a discourse around economic integration but to power outages, lack or tax revenue, fragile-to-non-existent infrastructure, and youth unemployment.

Since the transition to democracy, the Gambian economy accelerated to a 6% growth rate by the end of 2019; the coronavirus pandemic has stalled that growth.[^6] Inflation on the prices of essential goods has also eaten into domestic savings, but so far the Gambian monetary authorities have preferred to rely on donor aid rather than money-printing. Poverty remains widespread, with around half of the population living under the international poverty line.[^7] Lack of accessible healthcare is another contributor to low-life expectancy and standard of living in the country, one exacerbated by the strains of the pandemic.

## Truth, Reconciliation, \& Reparations

Despite being a de-facto one-party state under Jammeh, there was an elected opposition in the National Assembly, the Gambia's legislature. There voice was muted by the seats personally appointed by the President, but several prominent politicians in the current government served in opposition to Jammeh. These groups organised together as a united front against Jammeh in the 2016 election for the presidency, running independent Adama Barrow as their candidate. To everyone's surprise, they won, and Jammeh pledged to respect the result of the election -- until he didn't. After this reversal, ECOWAS troops moved in, overwhelmed the Jammeh-loyalist army, and presided over a democratic transition. Jammeh and his family fled to Guinea while Barrow was sworn in at the Gambian embassy in Dakar.  

Barrow was an unexpected candidate for leader. Born to a Mandinka father and Fula mother, he embodies the two largest ethnicities in the Gambia. He worked several odd jobs in London before entering Gambian politics in 2006 but never held office. Perhaps this was what made him precisely the candidate to defeat Jammeh: politically neutral and non-threatening to everybody. 

Once in power as president, Barrow promised a power-sharing agreement that would see him step down after three years and allow another leader within the coalition to take his place; he reneged on this promise and served his full term. The promised constitutional convention never happened. Within the cabinet, he sacked his coalition partners, notably Ousainou Darboe of the United Democratic Party, replacing them with members of a new party Barrow created, the National People's Party in 2020.

After Jammeh's ouster, the government appointed a Truth, Reconciliation, and Reparations Commission to investigate the crimes perpetrated by the dictatorship. Barrow suspended the hearings of the commission when the coronavirus pandemic broke out in the country, but resumed in recent months. Its findings were handed to President Barrow, who has yet to publish them or send them to the National Assembly. What is known so far is that members of the army, the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction, and Jammeh himself are implicated in crimes including extrajudicial killings of at least 240 people. It may be that Barrow is pursuing a policy of soft-amnesty for the perpetrators in the short-term, either to his own benefit or to smooth over the transition to democracy. 

The ECOWAS mission which stabilised the country as Barrow assumed power remains at his request, despite up to half of Gambians preferring their departure.[^9] Protests against Barrow reneging on the power-sharing memorandum of understanding were violently dispersed by police in January 2020, another worrying sign that the new government was backsliding into authoritarian tendencies. The movement, called "Three Years Jotna" (*Jotna* meaning *enough* in the Wolof language), was banned -- ironic, considering that the Jammeh Alliance party still legally operates.[^10]

### Elections in 2021

In the leadup to this year's elections, disturbing news broke that Barrow and the APRC had struck a deal to run as a united ticket, to the horror of everyone. Jammeh at first accepted the deal, but then reneged on it in typical fashion. The APRC split between Jammeh loyalists (under the banner of the Gambian Democratic Congress) and those seeking to distance the party from the dictatorship. Jammeh telephoned into party meetings to castigate Barrow's administration and call for his removal.

The country hosted its first presidential debate since the end of the dictatorship; sadly, the four leading candidates boycotted it. The issues which voters found most important were youth unemployment (the median age of the population is 18 years old) and agriculture. Candidates on the campaign trail promised infrastructure and electrification if they won, reflecting a discursive emphasis on material politics over social issues.

On December 4th, Barrow was re-elected as President while the remaining candidates (including Barrow's former ministers and Jammeh's preferred candidate) rejected the outcome.[^1] Some 962,000 people had registered to vote (just under half the population) and 859,567 turned out on election day for an 89% participation rate;[^5] Barrow won a reported 53% to Darboe's (of the UDP) 27%, with diminishing shares for the other parties.

To international observers, Barrow's victory was not a surprise,[^2] but surveys indicated that Gambian voters had no pre-existing expectations of who would win and expected a peaceful election. Importantly, as late as November 2021, there was still a sizeable number of undecided voters. The ongoing ECOWAS mission to protect the fledging democracy will hopefully remain a force for stability, but it is clearly evident that, were it not for ECOWAS, the country's political future would be worrying.

## Coronavirus

For a country of such meagre means, the Gambia has faired better than many during the ongoing CoViD-19 Pandemic. The country was hit by a first wave of infections in Fall 2020, then successive waves in Summer 2021 and Fall 2021. The last wave was the most significant as it more than doubled the cumulative number of cases and fatalities up to that point.[^8] After receiving the Johnson \& Johnson vaccine in July 2021, 268,000 Gambians have already been inoculated against the virus, which is an overall 13% vaccination rate. So far, there are over 9,000 ongoing cases in the country (0.45% of the population) with 342 dead (>0.01% of the population). The government had hoped to reach a 60% vaccination rate before 2022. Considering that the Gambia is reliant on foreign aid for vaccines and is unable to produce its own, these data could certainly be much worse.

Aside from the stress on the Gambian health system, the most important problem for the Gambia is the disruption to productivity in the world economy, which has made it difficult for entrepreneurs to pay employees and disrupted imports of complex goods. Demand for non-essential goods in the country has also fallen. Most relief has come from civil society organisations, particularly religious institutions, since the Gambian state is heavily dependent on tax revenue.[^3] The closure of the Senegambian borders during the pandemic also

## Conclusion

The greatest challenges which the Gambia faces remain economic development and institutionalising democratic norms. Perversely, the loss of the country's economic sovereignty seems to only be curable through more loss of said sovereignty -- integration with its neighbours and inviting foreign direct investment to utilise a cheap unskilled workforce. Likewise, the consolidation of democratic norms and traditions is dependent on the presence of foreign militaries, a further loss of sovereignty.

Nevertheless, the delay and obfuscation surrounding the TRRC report only serves to undermine the future of democratic transition; naming and bringing the perpetrators to justice would be key to dissuading more political violence and show the international community that the Gambia intends to take human rights seriously. The danger is that any prosecutions down the road might appear to be show trials against Barrow's rivals, so referral of the case to international human rights tribunals ought to be considered, even if that further undermines Gambian judicial sovereignty.
