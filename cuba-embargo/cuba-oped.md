As new variants of the coronavirus evolve each month, the prospects of an end to the pandemic seem farther out of reach. Here in the United States, we are privileged to have a surplus of vaccines, even if pet food, computer chips, and paper towels are in short supply. However, only 90 miles off the coast of Florida, the same problems are manifestly worse, and they are thanks to sixty years of failed US foreign policy.
