## Gent \& Shannon, 2011

The authors' hypothesise that unbiased brokers for adjudication in territorial disputes are more successful. This runs contrary to a body of literature suggesting that biased brokers are no worse in this regard. Furthermore, they conclude that the method of conflict resolution matters more than who or what the third party is. They focus on source-bias in the third-party as a variable.

They use the border dispute between Colombia and Venezuela to illustrate their point. The successful resolution of the dispute only happened after relying on Switzerland to arbitrate, which had no historical ties to either country unlike Spain. The reason is that a biased negotiator can't be truly trusted to adjudicate impartially, not because both parties expect an impartial broker to be more effective.

They find that non-binding arbitration agreements are not as effective because binding agreements create high reputation costs for defection. Even in the Guiana dispute, Venezuela accepted the clearly unfavourable terms for this reason. This provides domestic political cover for the negotiators on both sides. Binding resolutions carry more weight because they also establish international precedent, or at least the resolution refers to broader international customs and thus reinforces the importance of the agreement. 

One point which I think deserves to be raised is that inter-state disputes are fundamentally different animals from intra-state conflicts like a civil war. In the former, binding arbitration works because both sides, at least initially, recognise the right of the other to exist. Whereas sovereigns aren't risking their own existence, intra-state conflicts such as those discussed last week are much higher stakes. Disputants might not even want to recognise the other party at all, and binding resolutions, however effective they are in practice, would thus be off-the-table. 

Another limitation of their study is the sample size. This isn't to dismiss their claims categorically; studying the small-ish group of binding settlements in territorial disputes might be hard to generalise as a result.

On the theoretical scale, there isn't much attention given to structural biases within the world international system, seeing as they encode international courts as unbiased. Specifically, when they code the bias of IGOs, they rely on the biases of each member's own country but don't extend this practice to courts. The problem, as I see it, is that institutions in international courts may be less overtly biased to one state or another, but they undeniably must have a bias to the perpetuation of the international system. This becomes problematic when one or another claimant in a dispute views the structures of the international system as an obstacle, even if it allows them sovereign rights. So I'm not so certain that the impartiality of courts is valid, but I concede that it makes only a minor difference in their final analysis. 

## Mitchell \& Hensel, 2007

The authors argue that when International Organisations are actively involved in binding arbitration agreements, compliance of the disputants is more likely. Passive membership in institutions also promotes compliance with peaceful resolutions. Importantly, *how* these international institutions participate can alter how successful any deal will prove to be.

Mitchell/Hensel and Gent/Shannon, were they to talk to each other, would likely disagree over which is most important: the fact that institutions are involved, or that the institutions involved are impartial to disputants. For one thing, Gent and Shannon's conclusions regard a specific category of conflicts (territory) and not contentious issues more generally.
