## Walter, 1999

On page 145, she begins her discussion of the causes for why Mozambique's conflict settlement happened in '92. I wonder how this relates to what Morje Howard and Stark wrote about in 2018. 

## Notes:

Mozambique: 
- Both sides realised complete victory was impossible
- End of Cold War meant the Left lost the Soviet Support
- Drought
- Outside pressure
- all these, however, had happened before, except the second

Walter: Commitment problems -- guarantees that demobilisation =/= vulnerability
- This is the high-level peace agreements that Autesserre derides as "Peace Inc."

138: The Four pillars of institutional design
- Federalism
- Mutual Veto / Checks & Balances
- Proportional Representation in a Bicameral Legislature

Self-criticism
- Treaties should succeed whether or not outside forces actually arrive to enforce them, right? Record shows otherwise
- Selection bias -- only mediating "easy" cases. But how do you know when it's easy? What indicators do you use? The shortest or longest wars? or the deadliest? etc. 
- What about partitioning a country? that's asking for irredentism and inter-state wars, let alone secession

Conclusions
- Resolutions need outside enforcement
- Election-fetish is self-defeating
- Partial Demobilisation is acceptable
- Enforcement only matters short-term
