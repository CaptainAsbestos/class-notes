## Week 1 -- Intro

#### Discussion points

- The hegemonic powers which stabilise a balance are only able to do so by perpetuating violence on the frontier

- Peaceful for whom? Peace vs Security? 

- Peace as a bottom-up process

- Trade agreements doesn't necessarily motivate states to avoid armed conflict; some rival countries don't have any trade incentives (what does Saudi Arabia have that Iran would possibly want besides hard cash to invest?)

- Bargaining Theory of War (Fearon)

- Military Industrial Complex means that violence pays, regardless of victory or defeat for the US empire. The Peace Dividend was tried and didn't pay enough

- The theft of Surplus labour value is structural violence

#### Absence of Violence (*Peace Continuum* Davenport et al., 2018)
\
They break down negative peace into the following concepts:

- Order
- harmonious relationship
- trust
- reconciliation
- social integration 
    * especially after ethnic cleansing
    * Inter-state dependence (EU)
- justice / rule of law (punish \& deter rogue actors)
- Conflict resolution institutionalisation
- *socioeconomic opportunity*
- *political freedoms / civil rights*
- *equality / non-discrimination*

The italic points enjoy a reciprocal relationship with human rights. Some of these qualities can be met to establishing "peace" in a limited sense.

However, what do Davenport and co. think violence is? And is it safe to presume that positive peace is theoretically symmetrical to the absence of order?
