## Week 1 -- Intro

#### Discussion points

- The hegemonic powers which stabilise a balance are only able to do so by perpetuating violence on the frontier

- Peaceful for whom? Peace vs Security? 

- Peace as a bottom-up process

- Trade agreements doesn't necessarily motivate states to avoid armed conflict; some rival countries don't have any trade incentives (what does Saudi Arabia have that Iran would possibly want besides hard cash to invest?)

- Bargaining Theory of War (Fearon)

#### Absence of Violence (*Peace Continuum* Davenport et al., 2018)
\
They break down this concept into the following concepts:

- Order
- harmonious relationship
- trust
- reconciliation
- social integration
- justice / rule of law (punish \& deter rogue actors)
- Conflict resolution institutionalisation
- *socioeconomic opportunity*
- *political freedoms / civil rights*
- *equality / non-discrimination*

The italic points enjoy a reciprocal relationship with human rights. Some of these qualities can be met to establishing "peace" in a limited sense.
