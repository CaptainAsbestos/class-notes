## UN: Global Issues

The author first outlines the structures and mechanisms through which the UN tries to keep the peace between nations. The Security Council is the primary organ for this, working in conjunction with the Secretariat of the UN. UNSC resolutions sanction peacekeeping operations, ceasefire directives, economic sanctions, and so on. The General Assembly can also vote on resolutions regarding security matters, although the UNSC's P5 can veto them if they wish. The Secretary-General itself can rely on its position as an impartial mediator to bring military crises to the attention of either body.

The UN pursues two strategies to prevent disputes from devolving into armed conflict: preventative diplomacy and disarmament. Chief among the obligations that member-states have is the Responsibility to Protect peoples from genocide and mass atrocities; this principle is foundational to the UN Genocide Convention of 1948. Where diplomacy and disarmament fail, peacekeepers are deployed to enforce the directives of the UNSC and General Assembly. Peacekeeping missions have visited conflict regions around the world since 1945, although they are rarely deployed to politically polarising conflicts. Increasingly, peacekeepers have participated in intra-State conflicts rather than those between states. These missions often incorporate humanitarian goals.

Peacebuilding refers to the post-conflict process by which future violence can be averted, rather than merely ending hostilities, going home, and waiting for fighting to resume. This involves creating sustainable governing institutions, apportioning responsibility for conflicts, and promoting reconciliation between aggrieved parties. In 2005, the UN Peacebuilding Commission was established.
