## Diehl, 1993

Diehl begins with the interesting assertion that peacekeeping has "evolved out of the failure of collective security and the inadequacy of peace observation." Peacekeeping missions are only deployed *after* a conflict has arrived at an armistice. By inserting themselves between combatants, they can function as a buffer and mediator, preventing a breakdown of a cease-fire and hopefully promoting a settlement. Peacekeeping troops are armed only to the point of credible self-defence in service of their state mission. Lastly, they are neutral, as in, their presence is not in itself assigning blame or offering support unilaterally to one side. They require the permission of the host country to operate, which may itself seem non-neutral, but on the level of analysis -- the UN system -- this serves to differentiate peacekeeping from international police actions.
