On the question of which strategy of mediation works best, the authors write that there is no academic consensus. By the numbers, however, they find that most civil war mediations follow procedural strategies (the majority) or facilitative communication strategies (the next largest plurality) and rarely directive strategies. Curiously, the strategies of mediation mattered less than who the mediator was: mediated peaces tended to last longer, but only when a non-superpower arranged them. In secessionist wars, other researchers have found concurring evidence that formulative and facilitative strategies work best.
