## Course Description

This course introduce students to the scientific study of politics in the United States. The course has two components: a twice-weekly lecture with Dr. Ringenberg and a weekly discussion seminar with your \textsc{gta}. Attendance in both is mandatory. 

The discussion seminars are intended to let smaller groups of students explore the material we read and the content of lecture. You are all expected to raise questions and engage with each others' thinking. This allows the instructors to keep closer tabs on your performance as well. 

## About Me

I received my MA in International Affairs from Middle Tennessee State University in 2022; I'm currently in my third semester of my PhD work. I'm originally from Fort Collins, Colorado, but I've lived in Germany and Mainland China as well. My research interests are nationalist and populist movements in Western Democracies. In my spare time, I enjoy playing music, cooking, biking, and catching movies at Liberty Hall. 

## Textbooks

You are expected to read the assigned sections of this textbook before attending the lectures and section:

Ginsberg, B., Lowi, T. J., & Weir, M. (2019). We the people: An introduction to American politics. WW Norton & Company, Inc..\

If you elect to use the eBook, make sure to only use the links through the Canvas website (because it's cheaper!).

# Academic Expectations for Discussion Seminars

Refer to the master syllabus in the lecture webpage for how your grade fits into the broader schema. In this class, you will be assessed by your participation in class discussion. You are expected to participate in class discussions. This is your chance to demonstrate that you've prepared for class and can hold an informed conversation about US politics. My job as the \textsc{gta} is to moderate the discussion, not lead or participate in it.

This class will meet 12 times during the semester. When we have an in-class exam at Malott, your discussion section will not meet that week, but I encourage you to come to my office and review your exams with me.

# Miscellaneous Information

## Communication

For all matters related to \textsc{pols}-\oldstylenums{110}, the primary point of contact is your \textsc{gta}. You are encouraged to visit me during my standing "drop-in" office hours on Fridays, but if you wish to schedule a meeting I can set aside time for you specifically.

My office is in Blake Hall \oldstylenums{408}. If you wish to meet with me, please contact me via email so I can set aside time to devote to the matter. Do not send messages to me through the canvas app; email is the appropriate channel for communication. 

## Sickness \& Absences

If you are ill, you can't learn effectively; if you infect others, neither can they. If you fall sick and can't attend class, please send me the proper documentation from a doctor so I can excuse your absence. I much prefer that you call in sick rather than infect the rest of the class if your malady is contagious. I will not grant excused absences for retroactive notice; if you are conscious, you are able to and must notify me *before* our meeting that you'll be absent.

If major emergencies occur that require your absence, write to me explaining the situation as soon as you are aware. Retroactive excuses for absences are not valid. Only in the event of excused absences will I offer makeup work where applicable. If you fail to meet the makeup deadline, I will not extend it. 

If you need to report an extended illness or serious accident, please contact Student Support and Case Management at course-adapt@ku.edu or 785-864-4060. A case manager will send email notifications to your instructor(s) on your behalf. When you are able, you will need to follow up with me and your other professors to coordinate a temporary arrangement regarding missed instruction and coursework.

Legitimate reasons for absence include: 

- Religious observance
- Military service
- Personal verifiable mental health or medical crisis of that of a relative or friend
- Unforeseen life event or compelling circumstances beyond the student’s control
- Academic field trips
- Participation in university activities
- Jury duty or mandatory court appearance
- Professional association or conference participation
 
## Extra Credit

There are no extra-credit opportunities in this class.

## Academic Integrity 

All electronic assignments for discussion section will be turned in on the course website (Canvas) in the Portable Document Format (.pdf). This is a basic professional skill; if you don't know how to do this, learn how. Moreover, our plagiarism- and AI-detector only scan text documents submitted, not comments. **No other file types will be accepted for a grade.**

All work submitted must be original work begun and completed by each individual student. The following behaviours are strictly prohibited:

- **Plagiarism:** the adoption or reproduction of ideas, words, statements, images, or works of another person as one’s own without proper attribution. This includes self-plagiarism, which occurs when an author submits material or research from previous work to satisfy the requirements of another assignment and uses it without proper citation of its reuse. (The best way to avoid accidental plagiarism is to exercise an abundance of caution -- if you're ever unsure, consult with me and we'll make sure you don't run afoul of the rules!)
- **Cheating:** Using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any assignment. This includes unapproved collaboration, which occurs when a student works with others on an academic exercise without the express permission of the professor.
- **Fabrication:** Unauthorized falsification or invention of any information or citation in an academic exercise.
- **Facilitation:** Intentionally and knowingly assisting another student in violating a provision of the institutional code of academic misconduct.

Course materials prepared by the instructors of this course, including the syllabus and content of all lectures, are the intellectual property of the professors. Without permission obtained from the professor, recordings of lectures and review sessions may not be transferred or transmitted to any other person outside of this course. Any person or group of people violating the professors' copyright on course materials or lectures could be subject to charges of academic misconduct. 

Commercial note-taking is not permitted. Lecture notes and course materials are for personal use, and may not be sold to any person or entity in any form. Any person engaged in or contributing to the commercial exchange of notes or course materials will be subject to disciple, including academic misconduct charges. Note-taking provided by a student volunteer for a student with accommodations from the SAC, is permitted.

## Non-academic misconduct

Students who engage in disruptive behavior, including persistent refusal to observe boundaries defined by the professor regarding inappropriate talking, discussions, and questions in the classroom may be subject to discipline for non-academic misconduct for disruption of teaching or academic misconduct, as defined in the Code of StudentRights and Responsibilities (CSRR), Article 22, Section C, and the University Senate Rules and Regulations, Section 2.4.6. Article 22 of CSRR also defines potential sanctions for these types of infractions.

## Electronic Devices 

The use of laptops, tablets, and cell phones are not permitted during discussion section. If you have purchased digital editions of the textbooks, you are expected to have read them beforehand and keep your devices stowed during discussion. If you require technological accommodations to participate in class discussion, please contact the SAC as soon as possible so we can arrange for you to use electronics in class.

Outside of discussion, however, this class requires computer and internet access. Students should be adept at using web browsers, KU’s email services, and word processors for accessing the course website and completing assignments. If computer access or internet use is beyond your means, let me know ASAP so we can meet your needs.

## Late work Policy

Late work will not be accepted.

## Disability Access \& Accommodations 

The university is committed to equitable campus access and accommodations for disabilities. If you require accommodations for this course, please present the appropriate paperwork to the Student Access Center on Campus so that the proper arrangements can be made.
