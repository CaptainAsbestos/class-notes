# Defeating CoViD Begins With Ending the Embargo on Cuba

As new variants of the coronavirus evolve each month, the prospects of an end to the pandemic seem farther out of reach. Here in the United States, we are privileged to have a surplus of vaccines, even if pet food, computer chips, and paper towels are in short supply. However, only 90 miles off the coast of Florida, the same problems are manifestly worse, and they are thanks to sixty years of failed US foreign policy.

Cuba is experiencing the most serious political and economic crisis since the 1990s, the so-called "special period" after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the island's largest trading partner. Food and fuel shortages have returned as Cuba doubled down on healthcare spending (just as it had 30 years ago), successfully developing its own vaccine against CoViD-19 for export. Why export? Because the country lacks enough hypodermic needles to rapidly inoculate its citizens, so may as well ship them abroad. 

Everyday inconveniences such as this are part of daily life for Cubans, who have learned to adapt. The US, for its part, has failed to learn that embargoes and sanctions only work against diplomatically isolated countries with economies dependent on the US (case in point: Apartheid South Africa). 

Calculating the human costs of the embargo is not simple, but a look at history and other countries can give us an idea. In most post-Soviet states during the '90s, life-expectancy and other widely used standard-of-living metrics declined under rapid neoliberal shock therapy -- [the largest drop during any peace-time period in those countries since the Second World War.](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/16/world/europe/16europe.html) Presently in [Iran](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13696998.2020.1856855), sanctions have made a bad situation worse, as scarce medical equipment like ventilators and basic medicines (unrelated to CoViD) are too expensive for the system to procure. Expecting Cuba to jump off a political cliff to end the embargo is a non-starter. 

If the Biden administration really wants other countries to believe the so-called "rules based international order" is more than mere rhetoric, then it should begin by obeying it in Cuba. For 29 consecutive years, the embargo has been condemned by the UN General Assembly with only two nations consistently voting for it (the US and Israel, although recently also Bolsonaro's Brazil). The embargo is not upholding the rule of international law; it is unilateral collective punishment. Ending the embargo also emphasises continuity with the Obama administration's foreign policy, which was well received abroad and is sorely needed during the Trump hangover. 

The only obstacle towards reset with Cuba is Congress, and specifically Congressional Democrats. Not even Cuban American voters consider a politicians' position on the embargo a dealbreaker (indeed, it ranks [*dead last*](https://digitalcommons.fiu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1010&context=cuba_poll)[^1] on average); some support normalisation of relations and others (an aging, wealthy, and overwhelmingly Republican minority) are resolutely against even recognising Havana. But Cuba makes a convenient punching bag for humanitarians, who look past the human cost of the embargo, and a convenient source of campaign cash for state elections. Cuba policy in the US is evidently not *foreign* policy, it is *entirely domestic.* As the memories of the Cold War fade, Democrats have an opportunity to build a new pitch to Floridian voters that highlights *actual* humanitarian sympathy and concrete steps to bring the pandemic in the Americas to a swift end.
