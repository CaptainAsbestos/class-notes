# Introduction to American Politics

\pagebreak

## Acknowledgements

In the last weeks of summer in 2022, Dr. Maynor asked me to lead an online section of American Politics. I said yes without hesitation, since I wanted the experience of teaching a class on my own. At the beginning of the semester, I would have called myself keenly interested in US politics but no expert. Now, I think I've learned at least as much as my students -- or at least, I can only hope they have. Thanks to the generous help of Dr. Franklin, I had the course roadmap prepared for me, thus I owe him a tremendous professional debt. I also want to thank the many professors at the department with whom I've studied since 2019, without whom I would have been ill-prepared to take the plunge on this practicum.

For the purposes of the MAIA practicum requirements, this teaching experience was akin to a paid internship, in that I received a modest stipend and a more-than-modest tuition discount, which involved teaching undergraduate students the basics of political science, US political history, and the political system of the US. I essentially took a 3 credit-hour course along with my students, spending on average 12 hours in total per week working in ways I describe below; 12 hours per 12 weeks plus some additional time preparing and corresponding with students amounts to 150 man-hours of work spent on this course between August and December of 2022. 

In this report, I will describe various themes from my MA studies as they relate to the content of my section on American politics. These are not the most prominent themes within the course itself; instead, they are the topics and methods which relate to international affairs.

## Description of the Semester

I won't burden the experts of the committee with details on the Department of Political Science and the topic of American Politics. The text used was "American Politics and Government Today," a digital-only rental edition written by Schmidt, Shelley, and Bardes (published in 2022). I occasionally supplied extra readings, such as the Federalist papers or a peer-reviewed article. Allow me to briefly describe the schedule of the semester and the weekly topics:

1. Theories and Approaches to US politics
2. The Constitution 
3. Federalism
4. Civil Liberties
5. The Presidency
6. The Congress
7. The Civil Rights Movement
8. Interest Groups and Political Parties (Civil Society)
9. Campaigns Elections, and Voting Behaviour
10. The Judiciary
11. US Foreign Policy
12. US Domestic Policy

There were two exams, two papers, and weekly quizzes associated with each week of reading except the Civil rights movement. The quizzes were drawn near-verbatim from a previous edition of the textbook. At the suggestion of Dr. Maynor, my co-instructor, every quiz could be taken twice, with only previously-missed questions the second time. All the timed assessments were "open-book," since I believed any alternative policy to be unenforceable in a remote-learning course. Instead I enforced strict time limits, so that students had to internalise and recall the material, referring to their notes or books only to check facts or on difficult questions. Each week also required students to comment twice in a discussion forum relating to the materials. I drew discussion topics from the textbook, but often I preferred to provide topics related to supplemental readings. 

### *Extra Credit*

I offered a generous amount of extra credit at the start of the semester, equivalent to slightly less than the midterm exam in total. The intent was to incentivise students to learn something related to the course's themes and report their findings. Of the options for extra credit, I included volunteering with political campaigns during the election, attending guest lectures on campus, and writing a report on the business documentary, *The Colonel Comes to Japan*. Many students were keen on extra credit but lived too far from campus. Others were too busy to volunteer. So, I invented a fourth option, a survey of all the candidates running for office in their district, to compliment the eventual written assignment on representatives. Furthermore, rewarding students for researching their options before voting is good for democracy. Other students wanted to write more on specific topics, such as the governor's race this year, or the Netflix documentary "13th." I decided to reward their initiative with up to 20 points, equivalent to the standard option. I allowed students to submit as many extra credit assignments as they wished, but capped the overall bonus at 60 points against the final grade. This meant that one extra credit was slightly less than a 25-point quiz, and the 60 total slightly less than the 70-point midterm. This seemed fair to people who missed quiz deadlines or who performed poorly on the midterm. At the time of writing, the deadline for extra credit work has not passed. I expect to soon be assessing my way through an incoming tide of last-minute attempts to salvage grades in the lead up to the exam. Alas, this is my own fault for leaving the deadline so late in the semester, but the requirements of *written work* have so far prevented students from relying on extra credit as a crutch. 

### *Weekly Workload & Discussions*

The average week of work involved reading the week's textbook chapter, checking quizzes to see that the answers were correct, and researching for relevant news items or supplementary sources. Only with some difficulty did I find readings suitable for a 1000-level course, especially in light of two facts. First, many of the students in class were high-school dual enrolment, so I was wary of overloading them with peer-reviewed research. Second, only a handful of students are pursuing political science as their major, and few others stood to benefit much from a deep dive into the science while at a freshman level. But if nothing else, the research served to keep me better informed on the week's topic. Typically, the discussion posts arrived in a flood on the last night possible. Tinkering with the tools on D2L, I was unable to find a satisfactory mechanism to nudge people to submit earlier. I resigned myself to the fact that nothing can really be done. As a fellow student, I confess that procrastinating students are endemic to this line of work.

At first, I replied to students often, getting deep into the weeds on their thoughts. I then realised that if I spent so much of my time having these conversations, they were too: not a discussion, but an interrogation. Nobody feels they can afford to blow off a comment from their professor, and I didn't want to monopolise anybody's time. So, as an experiment, I tried a hands-off week where I just read comments and provided feedback in the grading rubric. Anecdotally, I observed that the quality of the discussions remained unchanged. The level of the debate was equivalently rich before and after, though as the course progressed I noticed that comments improved in robustness and remained closer to the topic. I attribute this trend to students becoming more familiar with US politics. The quiz grades cannot substantiate this claim, as they are all quite high, owing to the retake policy. For this reason, I would not necessarily preserve it in future remote-learning courses. We only have so many tools to gauge student progress at a distance, so retakes should be reserved for in-person courses or remote-learning classes with scheduled video-conferencing seminars.

Usually, only one topic per week appealed to students and became the subject of most debate. Typically it focused on facts rather than theory, or it was one directly pulled from the textbook rather than from supplemental reading. Below lists a sample of discussion prompts most related to international affairs which I contributed:

- What is the relationship between sovereignty, legitimacy, and power?
- What were the differences between the charters of the 13 colonies and Britain? (Author's note: this was a baby-step towards comparative legal study)
- How does the US Bill of Rights compare to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights? 
- What do political scientists mean by the term "imperial presidency?" What evidence do we have to support this concept's existence since 2002?
- What is the difference between a Parliament and the Congress? 
- Should the US ratify the Rome Statute and become party to the International Criminal Court?
- What is the national security state?
- Does the US still employ the Monroe or Truman doctrines? 
- What is the Washington Consensus?
- In a world of global dangers (climate change, pandemic, worldwide recessions), can we meaningfully distinguish between domestic and foreign policy?

Students had the choice to invent a discussion topic of their own or to choose one more specifically about US *domestic* politics, divorced from foreign political implications. Most pursued the latter course; I don't blame them. After all, global studies is a separate realm. Nevertheless I included these questions but not just so that I could report on them in this practicum. I firmly believe that an early exposure to international affairs helped me broaden my thinking and connect the dots between news events around the world and our own politics. Furthermore, the United States is a global hegemon, so we must all be cognizant of the downstream ramifications of events in DC.

### *Midterm Exam*

The midterm was a wake-up call for the class and myself. The highest score before adjustment was an 88%, the lowest a 40%, with a statistically normal distribution between those two limits. Figure 1 is a clipped screenshot of the grade distribution on this test.

![Grade distribution on midterm exam (after curve).](file:///home/alex/class-notes/practicum/midterm-curve.png)

Only one student dropped the course right after taking it. I hadn't modified the exam from when I inherited it from Dr. Franklin. My rationale was that identical exams make a consistent benchmark to measure student progress against other sections of the course. Now, I feel this was a mistake, and made sure to review and rewrite parts of the final exam for the following reason. The most commonly mistaken answers had no consistent theme but they could have been more succinctly and clearly worded. Topically, the hardest questions (by number of wrong answers) concerned theories of governance (limited government and federalism), the executive veto, and limits on constitutional freedoms. Less than 50% of the class got these ten questions correct, and I decided to write them off the grade as an amnesty. Once this happened, the highest grade was 100%, the lowest 50%, with a mean score of 82% (though the standard deviation was 13%). The modal scores were between 90-95%, with a long tail dragging the average downward, but in my opinion this distribution was optimal. While I am concerned that nobody did as well as hoped on the first pass, it meant the exam was not too easy. I also firmly believe that poor-wording was the culprit.

### *Final Exam*

At the time of writing, the final exam has yet to begin. I once again asked a colleague with a layman's understanding of American politics to take the exam; without the benefit of taking the class, they scored 82% on their first attempt. They were also the same colleague whom I asked to take the midterm as a control, and they confided in me that the final felt less challenging, especially with the longer time limit. 

Going into the finals week, I prepared an unofficial grade item that calculated current grades for every student but excluded the final. I reasoned that this would give everyone an idea of how much effort they should invest in the exam, since some students are on the cusp of a higher grade bracket. It will be interesting to see how these pre-exam grades correlate to the end result. Figure 2 is a chart with the current distribution of grades. 

![Pre-exam grade distribution for the class.](file:///home/alex/class-notes/practicum/pre-exam-curve.png)

The lowest grade at time of writing is 59.5%, right on the verge of a true F (this student has just missed lots of deadlines); the highest is 98.6%; the mean is 85.9%. The top-heavy distribution arose from the extra credit assignments of which many students' took advantage. It still bears mentioning that just as many low-scoring students made use of the extra-credit assignments to compensate for poor performance on essays or missed deadlines. I firmly believe that this did not constitute an unfair advantage, since the bonus was capped.

## Course Themes Relevant to International Affairs 

### *The Comparative Method*

It was fortuitous that I retook Comparative Politics the same semester as this practicum. Recalling the wonderful V-Dem Dataset Project from Dr. Wang's Comparative Politics Class, I began the semester by asking, "what is democracy, and how do we measure its change over time?" Figure 2[^1] is a chart showing the major democracy indices for the US since records began, which I included in a "day zero" slideshow for the class. Rather than the unhelpful binary question, "is America a democracy?", I asked students to consider how democratic the US *is*. This also put us on a more interesting research project -- we should instead hypothesise about "when and why" democracy expanded after major events, particularly major wars and crises. 

![V-Dem Country Graph for the United States' level of democracy since 1900.](file:///home/alex/class-notes/practicum/vdem-us-dark.png)

[^1]: This data comes from [V-Dem Project's Country Graph tool](https://v-dem.net/data_analysis/CountryGraph/), accessed in August of 2022.

I noted that the Participatory Index (cyan) and Egalitarian index (orange) swapped their position in the overall stack between 1968 and 1970. Around the world, the last years of the 1960s coincided with political turmoil, decolonisations, and massive leaps forward in political equality. Nonetheless, we must ask as scientists why this trend in the data reversed. Within the US, we can easily hypothesise that the Civil Rights Act increased the US's score on egalitarian measures of "democracy" almost overnight; secondly, the upward movement in the other four indices shows that the spike in egalitarianism correlates with the other components of democracy. Thus, the data supports the V-Dem tool as a valid measurement of democracy: all five seem to track similar and related phenomena. 

At various moments during the course, comparisons between the US and other federal systems, such as Germany and Canada, helped illustrate what "federalism" means. Most of us who grew up in the US don't really wonder what a more "unitary" national government might look like, even if state-level governments devolve very little power to local authorities. Other times, comparisons to Britain and France were helpful, to explain the origin of terms like republicanism, nationalism, head-of-state, and head-of-government. 

One problem with a comparative approach to US politics is that this course focuses on *American* politics. I was wary of wasting students' time with digressions into how other countries do things or even comparisons between the United States themselves. But at the same time, it was absolutely crucial that "American exceptionalism" be discarded as a concept. The US may be a unique and distinctive country, as all countries are. But it is not an exception to the rules. The laws of political reality govern all polities just as the law of gravity governs the trajectory of a ballistic projectile. If the US is experiencing different outcomes from the rest of the world, we as scientists must investigate what causes or circumstances create this different outcome. Chalking it up to the glorious virtues of republican government is not enough, which is why the comparative approach should supplement a single-country study paradigm.

For example, I sought to draw attention to the common law versus civil law dichotomy in world legal systems. In assigning [*The Napoleon Code or Complex* by Paul Reyes](http://journals.tulane.edu/teclf/article/view/1626/1470), a humorous essay discussing the way Louisiana's civil code interfaces with federal common law, I had two goals in mind. The first was to show how federal power-arrangements allow for political diversity even in legal codes. The second was, by way of comparison, to highlight principles unique to the common law system which otherwise governs the rest of the Anglosphere. Sadly, few students seemed keen to engage on that point, and I imagine that's because few of us are pre-law students. The most interesting takeaway, I feel, was that the gaps between Louisiana and the rest of the US were closing, legally speaking. The boundaries between the two schools of jurisprudence are not eroding per se but permeating into one another. Lawyers may puzzle themselves over the extra burdens in Louisiana's bar exam, but many argue the two systems are not as distinct as one might expect, especially on the question of case law and *jurisprudence constante* in civil law tradition.

### *"Party-systems" as units of analysis*

While the textbook did eventually discuss the historical analytical concept of "party-systems," I preferred to bring it up in the very beginning of the semester. This framework situates the US between two other Western democracies (in my mind), France and the UK: French historiography clearly delineates between successive "republics" while the British parliamentary system is a "continuous" expansion of the franchise. American party-systems straddle this divide: a continuous constitutional order, yes, but punctuated with moments of political turmoil that reconfigure coalitions and structures of power. 

I find this framework useful because it is scientifically helpful. We can generate historical hypotheses about current politics by anticipating if a realignment is building. To draw in a concept from Dr. Morris's Comparative Politics class, David D. Latin writes in *Nations, States, and Violence* (2007) about nations as imagined communities constructed from mutual identification and maintained by incentive structures and by cultural entrepreneurs. A group's or nation's demographic identity are not primordial and change happens rapidly as incentives to support the status quo lose their power (Latin gets this 'tipping game' model from another author, economist Thomas Schelling, who deserves credit here as well). Something similar happens during party realignments; the old guard lose legitimacy and the party crumbles, losing moderate voters briefly to the other side as an insurgent faction reshapes the remains.

The class implicitly alluded to such a realignment in the recent years of history. As one student told me over the phone, they were wary of talking too much about how the Republican Party has transformed. I replied that the same holds true for the Democrats, as an insurgent left has established a toehold against the establishment. The American identity and the identities of the two parties are changing -- does this mean we are due for a new party-system? Nobody has an answer yet.

### *Misperception*

I found myself recalling one particular essay from Dr. Tesi's Political Theories class quite often, [Robert Jervis's Hypotheses on Misperception.](https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/wpot20&i=464) I referred to it occasionally in discussions, but more often I found myself recalling Jervis's warnings with respect to remote learning, which I've included as an appendix to this report. Specifically, I want to draw attention to number six on the list, paraphrased thus: "When people spend a great deal of time drawing up a plan or making a decision, they expect that the message they wish to convey is obvious to the intended receiver." Since I knew exactly none of my students personally, only through the black box of the computer, I faced the problem of receiver-operator error. With only a discussion board, quizzes, and essays to judge progress, how certain can I be that students are learning what I intended to impart on them?

On the one hand, it's always a pleasant surprise when somebody learns something unintended. It's a cliché, but we learn as much from our students as they learn from us. I worried, however, that the lessons I sought to impart, specifically a critical (if not sceptical) eye cast on the institutions of US politics was lost in the noise. I settled for hoping that, rather than persuade hearts and minds, students would come away with a more informed and sharpened understanding of their own beliefs about American Politics. 

Jervis's misperception essay, published at the height of the Vietnam War, was a metaphorical wellspring to return to in discussions. In foreign policy week, I asked students to share their thoughts on the National Security state and how it influences domestic politics. The securitisation of domestic politics was a recurring theme (in my writing) throughout many of my classes in MAIA program even if it wasn't a specific topic. For the National Security State in US Politics, I wanted to impress upon the students that "fact-based" decision-making rarely occurs. The commander-in-chief necessarily must use judgement in the absence of reliable information, and the Nat-Sec organs which curate intelligence have political agendæ of their own. Regardless, the class seemed to prefer "facts over opinions" guiding policy, as well they should; but, by opinions do they mean 'ideology?' And is there an Overton-window of ideology, outside of which lies "opinions" and within it lies "facts?" I never got an answer, and that's fine. The purpose of these questions is to know that other alternatives *may* exist.

### *The US's Role in the World*

In the Judiciary and law unit, I assigned four op-eds concerning the US's relationship to the International Criminal court -- or rather, its lack thereof. I assigned it in the legal system module in hopes that people would bring it up later when we covered foreign policy, but nearly nobody brought it up. At any rate, I selected pieces from two politicians ([John Bolton](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-russia-icc-international-criminal-court-prosecute-war-crimes-hague-civilian-deaths-murder-rape-torture-bucha-massacre-11649943450) and [Ilhan Omar](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/04/13/icc-war-crimes-putin-russia-us-should-join/)), a [human rights NGO](https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/10/31/icc-afghanistan-inquiry-can-resume), and a [pair of legal experts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/04/05/us-international-criminal-court-russia-war-crimes-putin-ukraine/) so that we had a good spread of ideological positions. Three of them related to the invasion of Ukraine in March, and the last related to US war crimes in Afghanistan.

As much as I was loathe to include Bolton's writing, his argument was at least coherent, valid, and representative of a major school of international relations. For those reasons and because of, not despite, his tenure in the Trump administration, I hoped people would consider why he personally opposed the Rome Statute. Omar's piece presented the case for progressive internationalism, and therefore assumed an entirely different set of priors to Bolton's hard nationalism. To some, Bolton and Omar represent the political extremes, a characterisation to which I do not subscribe, but they make for a useful comparison. 

Sovereignty is a concept that I did not fully understand when I began my studies in Political Science, and only with the benefit of hindsight do I see how critical this concept is to the discipline. Thus, I wanted to impart what I learned in my studies to novice political scientists: if they remember nothing else from this course, I want them to be able to at least recall the meaning of the term and be able to talk about it fluently. The topic or sovereignty returned as we moved into discussions on globalisation. I made a point to connect economic matters to sovereign rights, especially as a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty has precipitated a world economic crisis. The American response to the invasion, particularly an attempt to stabilise prices, sees one sovereign state attempting to weaponise monetary policy to coerce another. An inevitable reality, if one asks a realist, but I asked my students to ponder if this was "fair," especially to countries which prefer to remain neutral. 

### *The* demos *\& Democracy in Crisis*

One of the themes of Dr. Morris's course has been "liberal backsliding" in major democracies around the world, and the US is no exception. The edition of the textbook we are using was released since 2021, so the events of the Trump administration come up occasionally. But the authors do not make many specific references to rising illiberalism in the US. Rather, they prefer to present case-studies occasionally. In the online discussions, students broached this theme far more often, which I was glad to see. Even if many are concerned about growing polarisation, or if most people detest career politicians, all sides agree that democracy was on the ballot in 2022. And exit polls bore this out: even deniers of Biden's victory in 2020 acknowledge that "democracy is in crisis." Democracy for whom, I wonder? 

### *Foreign Policy & the Imperial Presidency*

As a major oversight, I accidentally left a discussion forum for Foreign Policy on "hidden" without realising it until it was too late. Rather than expect students to do double the work in a single time frame, I took my foul-up as an opportunity: the week after was "domestic policy," and I decided to blend the two. In an era of globalised threats, such as climate change, pandemic, and recession, the boundaries between a "domestic" political problem and an "international" one dissolve. The actions of a single sovereign within its boundaries can harm people around the world, so should political scientists really insist on reteaching this outdated dichotomy? I asked them, how does foreign policy come home and how does domestic policy spill out? Most of the class chose not to engage on that discussion topic, focusing instead on the independence of the Federal Reserve. But that itself is "domestic policy spilling out" -- the money supply and credibility of the US treasury significantly affect the health of the world economy. 

During the week on the Presidency, I floated the topic of the "imperial" presidency's return since 2001. I was first exposed to the concept in US Foreign Policy with Dr. Korobkov, an undergrad course, but it came up in discussions throughout my studies in MAIA. On the exam for US politics, I asked students to write about the concept's validity and supply examples of imperious executive actions in American history. To my surprise, few cited either the Vietnam War (the event which minted the term) or the US's wars since 2001. Instead, most pointed to the New Deal and Reconstruction as imperial presidency. I don't feel that they are wrong -- certainly, if most answered the same, then I asked the question poorly -- so let us consider the difference between expansion of federal power versus imperial behaviour in Foreign Policy. When I consulted Dr. DiCicco, he raised the possibility that partisan disposition could colour how we view unilateral presidential action. I am inclined to agree: humanitarian interventions in the '90s were undertaken without declaration of war, paving the procedural path for decades long expeditions in southwest Asia. And with respect to Reconstruction and the New Deal, these projects were met with hostility from political powers here in Tennessee. More importantly, the historical memory of these projects, mediated by the American education system, led many (myself included) to a prior position of negativity towards these expansions of federal authority.

Curiously, nobody drew the connection between the federalisation of national guard units during the '60s and the imperial presidency. That was probably because I didn't ask, since the topic of their paper was to understand how SCLC turned the tragedies of the Selma march into a public-relations victory. It comforts me to know that this unrepresentative sample of mostly young people are entirely sympathetic to the cause of civil rights, even if their feelings do not extend to the 19th century.

### *Globalisation*

I first saw the 1981 documentary *[The Colonel Comes to Japan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwwmKcFVji8)* almost ten years ago in an Introduction to Asian Politics course. Despite its brief 27-minute runtime, it made a strong impression on me because it shows how various economic and social trends intersected in the Japanese economy at the start of the Bubble era. Why do I feel this documentary was relevant to American Politics? I hoped that the class would pick up on it in their reports, but here I will include my own takeaways of the film to explain my choice. 

The documentary tells the story of how Kentucky Fried Chicken became the first American fast food business to successfully enter the Japanese market. According to the narrator, Japan's reputation as impenetrable to foreign economic interests is deserved. Japanese consumers in 1981 had no real interest in American-style fried chicken. A Huntingtonian theorist would point to the pre-Meiji isolation of the islands as an explanation -- a sort of primordial "closed-off-ness" in Japanese economic policy -- but I think there's more to it. An oversimplified civilisational hypothesis doesn't help explain why KFC eventually did break through, and we are in poor position to theorise why else. The documentary points to a more useful and interesting explanation.

To adopt a more cynical view of globalised political economy, the company made three innovations to its strategy which allowed it to succeed where others had failed, as listed below: 

1. KFC partnered with established Japanese conglomerates to profit from their connections and scale; 

2. KFC artificially created demand for American-style dining experiences where none had existed; 

3. KFC poached Japanese experts from other companies to run the local operation. 

I claim that the special relationship between the US and Japan created a laboratory market for KFC to workshop the strategies which would lead it to success in the rest of East Asia. These conclusions have clear implications for our understanding of economic and cultural globalisation. I had hoped the documentary would stir my students to think about them (since there was no section of the course dedicated to American Political Economy or Globalisation). 

The first implication is that liberal economic policies which permit and facilitate multinational companies will have serious consequences for small and medium size businesses. KFC opened franchises in "hole-in-the-wall" style locations in cramped market districts, directly competing with mom-and-pop ramen shops and such. Even though the franchise-owners made goodwill visits to local businesses, it was clear that the nationally coordinated fast food chain benefited from economies of scale which their competitors did not have. Without special political protections from MNCs, artisans and small entrepreneurs will face a declining position in the economy. We must consider how MNC activity, in aggregate, affect people's attitudes towards globalisation.

Second, KFC and its local partner, Mitsubishi, created demand where none existed. The zaibatsu had a glut of poultry with no buyer, and KFC stepped in to fill the role. Rather than the typical notion that "entrepreneurs fill unfulfilled market niches," the creation of KFC Japan was a solution in search of a problem. The company never sought to "japan-ify" its brand. Instead, they played up Japanese perceptions of "American-ness." It was as if Edward Saïd's Orientalist theory were turned inside out -- "occidentalism," if you will, an Eastern gaze towards the West. KFCJ's marketing closely tied the brand to American traditions and folklore, creating consumer traditions like "Christmas Dinner at KFC" and characterising Colonel Sanders as a quasi-Johnny Appleseed mythic figure. While the branding promoted the products perceived American-ness, the product itself and the service were tailored to Japanese tastes and customs. 

Even though the main figure of the documentary is an American and former IBM executive, much of the staff managing the Japanese operations were Japanese. Chairman Loy Weston had the good sense to defer and delegate to the ambitious business men who worked for him, allowing them to make drastic changes to their market strategy. From a developmental economic perspective, the hope is that an MNC benefits from a new market access and local franchisees and executives learn from the exchange, reinvesting that knowledge capital elsewhere in the economy. (Curiously, at the annual stakeholders' fête, none of the Japanese franchisees were indulging in fried chicken.) This begs the question, why the need for KFCJ? Would these ambitious men and women not have found gainful employment elsewhere? Were the disruptions to diet and business worth it? Macroscopically, was this prosperity only possible in a globalised economic system, or was KFCJ's success merely piggybacking on an unsustainable consumer-spending bloom? Would this have ever happened had the US not had such a hegemonic presence in the Japanese economy? 

These heady questions, if I may be so bold, are probably beyond the scope of a 1000-level politics class. But I was first exposed to this documentary in my freshman year, and therefore my students stood to possibly profit from watching it as I did. Ironically, many were left with an optimistic attitude towards Japan's economic future when writing their reports. I regret not providing the context of the economic bubble and stagnation throughout the '90s, but this did reveal to me the power of business propaganda.

## Lessons Learned

The class informally served as an anecdotal focus-group with a non-representative sample of people living in the US. We had a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, education levels, age, and occupations; all brought something unique to the table, and I feel privileged to be an audience for their thoughts on American politics. This aspect was one of the highlights of the experience: not only was I leading them through a journey of academic discovery, I was also getting real time feedback as we went along. Despite the ups-and-downs, this experience reminded me why I want to be an educator. I hope the positive feelings are mutual on my students' part.

It was interesting to see how unexpected their views were, which I'll briefly summarize. Most everyone detests politics and politicians; they value the independence of bodies like the Federal Reserve and Supreme Court without question. Despite my feelings that we should regard unelected officials more critically, it seems that the American faith in institutions has endured the last six years. Most everybody regards the Trump administration scornfully, though their affection for the Democrats is being tested. On a most positive note, their patriotism and love of country includes many people unlike themselves, and they all remain committed to the project of American democracy. I can only admire their courage as my own has waned lately. In discussions, they are kind and receptive to new information; many are talented writers who are already making the most of the opportunities our university provides them. It has been a privilege to learn with them.

In conversations with students, I was troubled by comments they made that the exam questions did not have strict correlations with what was in the textbook and discussions. I hadn't modified the midterm exam much at all from Dr. Franklin, but I hadn't "taught to the test" either. The grade curve on the midterm was indeed statistically "normal" after adjustment, but the student who first brought this to my attention was one of the better ones. If they felt this way, that bore ill for the rest. I made sure to rewrite the final to take into account her comments, going so far as to ask a friend of mine without interest in politics to take the test as a benchmark.  

I know that this is not something the review committee will want to hear, but I found my notes from undergraduate studies to be as helpful as my lessons in graduate studies. It was unavoidable for one reason: graduate work specialises in more advanced topics, while my undergraduate work lay on a level nearer to a 1000 level course. I am so glad I kept my old papers, notes, books, and photocopies rather than renting or deleting them. They helped me bring in heavy concepts without making them indigestible for first-time political science students. After I complete my Master's here at MTSU, I suspect that I will refer to my MAIA materials for assistance wherever I work.

At this point, I should remark on how this experience has informed my development as a professional. I now have an honest appreciation for the hard work that the committee members take every day. The last semester has shown me that my weak areas remain my lack of experience outside Academia. But even if I do not go on to work as a professor or teacher, I know much more now about leading groups of people through a long project. I also cannot imagine how hard it would have been to invent the syllabus from scratch, so I must once again thank the incomparable Dr. Franklin for his assistance in August. Were I to begin a new class on a different topic, I feel very well-prepared. 

As my first chance to teach a class, I can say one thing for certain: remote learning must not become the future of education. In person contact with students is essential for their success. Those who reach out to me privately performed much better after our communication. That raises an immediate red flag. One student should not benefit from currying a stronger relation with their professor than those who do not. I made a point to publicise feedback from which the entire class could profit, but obviously individual students have individual needs. Since I intend to apply for adjunct work at a community college when I graduate, I will prefer to work in person as much as possible if allowed. If not, then I at least have a greater appreciation for the difficult task ahead. 

In grading papers, I was glad to see that writing quality improved over the course of the semester, not just in content but also in form. I had no preference for document format at all, and I believe more strongly now that strict penalties for font choice, spelling and grammar, etc. add nothing to a student's learning experience. I made sure to inform people of minor mistakes and provide tips on how to improve.

At risk of flattery, I still believe that Dr. Carleton's online classes are the gold-standard for remote learning. He provides a breadth of audio-visual media, journalism, supplemental reading, and a strong textbook (specifically the one for Global Studies). If given more time to prepare, I would want to assign more primary material from "Democracy in America" by de Tocqueville and the Federalist Papers. YouTube lectures from university-level scholars are a good free resource that recreate the classroom lecture experience within the flexibility of remote-learning, but they make assessing retention difficult (as I learned early on during the constitution week). The recorded lecture by Dr. Franklin on civil rights was also ideal, and I would have recorded my own, had I a PhD lending credibility to my words. 

For my future prospects, this practicum has immediate ramifications for my plans to work in education. I now feel confident that I could teach this class again, and I strongly suspect that 101 level US politics is a class in high demand. I would want to broaden my horizon by also curating a course for global studies, which sits closer to my preferred field of interest but broad enough to have appeal at most community colleges. As a former dual-enrolment student, the experience of teaching high school students is also a very useful resumé-builder. Despite my personal suspicions about dual-enrolment as education policy, there will probably be more pre-college students as time passes, and professors who are attentive to their needs will be important.
