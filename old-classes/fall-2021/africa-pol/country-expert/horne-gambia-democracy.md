# Gambian Democracy

After Independence from Britain, the Gambia was one of the oldest multi-party democracies in Africa, but it was still prone to the same tendencies of military coups and state-centralisation. The country's small size compounded the effect of these trends. Since the end of the Cold War, political democracy in The Gambia was suppressed by the Yahya Jammeh dictatorship, which rose to power following an officer's coup in 1994. His party, the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation \& Construction (APRC) remained in power until 2017, when an effective opposition coalition mobilised to defeat him in the presidential election. Jammeh initially accepted the outcome, but then quickly reneged, which precipitated the intervention of the Senegalese military under the aegis of an ECOWAS mandate. Jammeh entered exile in Guinea, and Adama Barrow of the UDP became president under the terms of a power sharing agreement with his coalition partners.

Reflecting a broad trend in democratic transitions, the 2017 coalition had a single mobilising issue which transcended all other divisions (removing Jammeh), but since then they have struggled to maintain cohesion without this rallying cause. Barrow began his term by promising that elections would be called in three, rather than the constitutionally mandated five, years.[^1] However, by 2019, Barrow rescinded that commitment and refused to call elections, which precipitated protests against him. These protestors were arrested and their movement, the "3-years Jotna" banned by the government.[^2] So, while there was nothing really more than a handshake agreement preventing Barrow from serving a full five year term, the crackdown on dissent over the deal is a worrying sign that the opposition was not itself liberal.

As Barrow entered the end of his term in 2020, members of the United Democratic Party's old guard were removed from his cabinet. Barrow then launched his own party, the National People's Party.[^3] More worrying was the announcement of a coalition between Barrow's NPP and the APRC moving into the 2021 presidential election.[^4] The question of amnesty for Jammeh is an ongoing story, as some APRC members have sought to distance themselves from Jammeh.[^5] Meanwhile, the Truth, Reconciliation, \& Reparations Commission established to prosecute perpetrators of criminal acts for the Jammeh dictatorship remains in a state of ongoing delay.[^6]

On the legislative front, the Gambian National Assembly since 2017 has been dominated by the Ousainou Darboe's UDP (he was a former cabinet minister with Barrow) and its coalition partners. Elections for the seats are conducting using the first-past-the-post method for the districts of the Gambia, except for 5 of the 58 seats which are appointed by the president. Despite the FPTP system, there is still a wide constellation of political parties thanks to the wide diversity of ethnic groups in the Gambia, despite the country's small population and geographic size. Political parties which predate the Jammeh dictatorship remain proscribed. During the Jammeh regime, the APRC dominated over the remaining opposition, who were still permitted to sit in the Assembly.

Turning to empirical measures of democracy, Freedom House evaluated The Gambia as a "Partly Free" country, scoring a 46 of possible 100 points in 2021.[^7] The Varieties of Democracy Project, which tracks indicators of democracy over time, shows that pre-2017, the country was near the minimum of "no democracy" before rising substantially.[^8]

The question remains: what social phenomena influence political democracy in the Gambia? To answer this, it is helpful to examine the bookends of Jammeh's dictatorship, which are watershed moments in the history of the country. First, the Jawara administration in 1994 was a classic centralised African nationalist government. In the thirty-two years the PPP wielded power, the Gambian economy, utterly dependent on a single river basin with minimal domestic industry, was especially vulnerable to global economic fluctuations, and began a comprehensive structural adjustment programme in 1985. Opportunities for corruption from the SAP reversed the promising gains, and by Jammeh's coup in 1994, the Gambia was one of the poorest countries in Africa. 

During the Jammeh administration, the economic downturn did not reverse, as Jammeh withdrew the Gambia from multilateral political and trading blocs; however, the economy began to grow again in the 2000s. The extreme human rights abuses of the administration, more than anything else, motivated the coalition to defeat him in 2017. Moving into 2022, it seems likely that democratic stagnation will continue as Jammeh seeks amnesty and Barrow seeks to avoid another APRC coup.
