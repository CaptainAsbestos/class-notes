# Poster Notes for Honours Symposium

Friday 31 March 2023

## Agenda

- Elevator Pitch
- Make a Poster
- Color Scheme
- Layout

## Elevator Pitch

- KISS principle
    * guests are members of the public and industry
    * Avoid jargon and acronyms
- Prepare at least 5 minutes
    * Practice pivoting and answering off-the-wall questions
    * Be aware of audience focus, try to keep it conversational
- Have a clear idea of the thesis
- Posters need to ensnare passers-by with just enough info to pique their interest, but not so much to overwhelm the eyes
    * details are in the presenter's head

## Color Scheme

- Use ACC purple
- Limit it to one color for highlight, an emphasis, and a comment
- Dark Primary (gradient)
- Primary 
- Background 
- Body Text
- Accents

## Layout

- Logical format that is easy to follow -- arrows should be redundant with good layout
- consider using boxes
- Sans serif faces such as Akzidenz Grotesk, Latin Modern Sans Demi, Ubuntu, Frutiger, Lucida Sans
- No smaller than 24 point for body text (excludes references)

## Posters

- 2 by 3 feet maximum -- measure those dimensions on a white board and sketch it out first
- Print 2 -- one for the College to keep, one for Felicity to Keep
- Get submissions for posters in at least 10 days in advance
- PowerPoint format preferred
- Put ACC watermark and name of the conference on the top
- minimal text
- Include references and acknowledgement on the poster -- but only the references which are needed for the poster's content
    * (use smaller type for this)
- Format:
    * What you want to do: Abstract (includes results) or Introduction (no results)
    * How you want to do it: Methodology and lit review are integrated
    * Why it matters: Conclusions
