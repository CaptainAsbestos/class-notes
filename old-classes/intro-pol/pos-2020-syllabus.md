## Computer or Technology Equipment Needed for the Course

This course requires a computer and internet access. ACC has a computer lab and technicians to assist you if necessary. We will have digital reading materials and quizzes hosted on the Desire2Learn Course website; I also strongly encourage students to stay in touch with me by email with questions. If computer access or internet use is beyond your means, let me know ASAP so we can meet your needs.

## Computer and Digital Literacy Skills Needed for the Course

This class requires proficiency with a word processor (such as LibreOffice) and internet browser (such as Firefox). I ask that *all written work be submitted in the Portable Document Format (PDF)* for the following reasons: first, bad actors can't edit your work's content; second, PDF files are universally readable by free software; third, PDF is the standard for all industries; and fourth, exporting to PDF is a good practice to learn.

Over the course of the semester, you will practice researching online materials to write about political science. If you require assistance with technology in this class, let me know ASAP by whatever means are convenient so that we can meet your needs.

## Classroom Technology Policy

If you need to take a phone call or respond to a text during class, please just step outside the classroom until you are finished. Otherwise, please keep phones on silent or vibrate. Laptops and tablet devices are permitted in class, but only to write notes and reference digital resources. If the use of such devices becomes disruptive or I feel that they are becoming an obstacle to class focus, then I reserve the right to amend this policy to prohibit them at any time (with sufficient notice to the class). Please do not abuse this privilege! 

If you require assistive technology to accommodate a disability, please inform me of your needs (to the extent you feel comfortable sharing). See "Accommodations Statement" below for more details.

## Academic Expectations

### 1. Participation \& Attendance

Attendance is required in this class. You are expected to attend class meetings on Mondays and Wednesdays from 13:00 to 12:15. Every student is permitted one unexcused absence for the semester. Please contact me in advance if you have a schedule conflict which can't be resolved. Lastly, if you feel sick, please do not come to class. No education is worth infecting others and it's difficult to learn well when you feel unwell, so just send me an email and we can work around it.

Participation in class discussions and online fora is expected of every student. Come to class prepared to ask a question of clarification and offer constructive critique of other students' ideas. 

### 2. Exams

There will be a midterm exam and a final exam, composed of multiple choice and short essay questions. The purpose of these exams is to verify that students can recall material from the readings and reflect critically on it. Both exams will be open book and administered over the internet. Each exam may only be taken once.

### 3. Twice-Weekly Précis

Students will be required to submit a précis summarising the contents of weekly assigned readings. The length of these assignments is no more than a page per reading; any longer and you aren't really summarising anything? The papers must be submitted to their appropriate dropboxes on the course website by the specified due date (usually, the midnight before class). The Portable Document Format (.pdf) is preferred; otherwise I have no preference for formatting and style. Written assignments will be graded on clarity, accuracy, and critical rigour. 

For the content of a précis, I am looking to see the main ideas of the reading summarised in your own words. You may quote the text directly, but for no more than a sentence or so. You are also encouraged to comment on the arguments or contributions an author makes. I intend for you to use these summaries as notes to assist you during class discussion. If you have difficulty understanding the reading, then simply make a note of what is confusing in your précis -- this helps me know what areas I should focus on.

### 4. Extra Credit

There will be four extra credit assignments in this course, to be announced at a later date. See the "Extra Credit" section under "Content" on D2L for more information.

## Late-work Policy

Out of fairness to other students, I will be enforcing deadlines for all exams strictly. Exceptions can be made in cases of legitimate emergencies or problems, but as instructor I reserve the right to enforce or adjust deadlines for assignments. To encourage everyone to complete written assignments even if they are late, all late papers  can still be handed in up until the **9th of May** and earn up to 50\% of their possible value. For example, if a paper normally scoring 14/20 points is handed in late, it will earn 10/20 rather than 7/20.

## Grade Breakdown:

- Twice-weekly Précis: 25 précis x 10 points = **250 points**
- Attendance \& Participation: 26 class sessions x 5 points = **130 points**
- Midterm Exam: **100 Points**
- Final Exam: **120 Points**
- Extra Credit: Up to **80 Points**

Total: **600 points**

As instructor, I reserve the right to revise the grade scheme with sufficient advance notice to the students.

## Miscellaneous Information

### Communication

My office is in Littleton Main, Room \textsc{m}\oldstylenums{4795}; I will be there Mondays \& Wednesdays from \oldstylenums{11:30} to \oldstylenums{15:30} with our class in the middle of my office hours. Email is the best way to reach me: [Alex.Horne@arapahoe.edu](Alex.Horne@arapahoe.edu). Additionally, you may call me at \oldstylenums{(970) 689-0909}; leave a text message (with your name included) if I am unable to pick up. Conference calls over Zoom are also possible by appointment.

The D2L email client is not very user friendly and I don't always receive messages sent through there in my primary inbox. Furthermore, external or personal email accounts may automatically end up in my primary's junk folder. Please bear this in mind when you email me *through* D2L or other means rather than your primary ACC email.

I will often make announcements on the Homepage of the Course Website on D2L, so be sure to check them at least daily. These may include extra credit opportunities, changes to schedules or grade schemes, &c.

### Classroom Community \& Mutual Respect

Our classroom belongs to everyone in this class. The beginning of wisdom is learning to listen to others and honour their thoughts with your attention. No one voice should dominate our discussions in class, so expect your ideas and arguments to be respectfully and constructively challenged by your peers. And lastly, if someone disagrees with you, don't take it personally; the purpose of classroom discussion and debate is not to win, but to practice talking and debating.

### Academic Integrity

All work submitted for a grade in this course must be original work begun and completed by each individual student. The following practices are strictly prohibited:

- **Plagiarism:** the adoption or reproduction of ideas, words, statements, images, or works of another person as one’s own without proper attribution. This includes self-plagiarism, which occurs when an author submits material or research from previous work to satisfy the requirements of another assignment and uses it without proper citation of its reuse. (The best way to avoid accidental plagiarism is to exercise an abundance of caution -- if you're ever unsure, consult with me and we'll make sure you don't run afoul of the rules!)

- **Cheating:** Using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any assignment. This includes unapproved collaboration, which occurs when a student works with others on an academic exercise without the express permission of the professor. Again, it's better to ask in advance or make a note that you collaborate with your peers -- in most cases, nothing would make me happier to hear that you are working together!

- **Fabrication:** Unauthorized falsification or invention of any information or citation in an academic exercise. Furthermore, the use of artificial intelligence to generate written work is also prohibited.

- **Facilitation:** Intentionally and knowingly assisting another student in violating a provision of the institutional code of academic misconduct.

### Student Resources

See ACC's Student Resources page at [https://www.arapahoe.edu/academics-programs/catalog/student-resources-and-services](https://www.arapahoe.edu/academics-programs/catalog/student-resources-and-services) and the Student Support page at [https://www.arapahoe.edu/advising-support/student-support](https://www.arapahoe.edu/advising-support/student-support).

### Technical Support

### Accommodations Statement

ACC provides accommodations to students with diagnosed or suspected disabilities that affect them in academic settings. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) defines a disability as a “physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activity.” This may include learning, mobility, and/or cognitive disabilities; mental health conditions; temporary disabilities; and other physical and/or mental conditions. To protect student privacy, disability information is kept separate from academic records.

Students with accommodations are responsible for requesting their accommodation letter each semester and for knowing current accommodation policies and procedures. Accommodations start when your instructor receives your accommodation letter and not before. It may take several days to create your accommodation letter, and some accommodations (testing, etc.) need to be requested at least 7 days in advance. So please request accommodations early. Students and instructors are encouraged to have a conversation about accommodations and how they apply in each class. Please contact Disability Access Services (DAS, [www.arapahoe.edu/das/](www.arapahoe.edu/das/)) for more information. To request accommodations, please contact DAS at [disability.access@arapahoe.edu](disability.access@arapahoe.edu) or \oldstylenums{(303) 797-5860}. Students can also schedule an intake appointment online through Navigate.
