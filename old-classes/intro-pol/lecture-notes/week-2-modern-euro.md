# European History since 1648: Imperialism

In the aftermath of the Westfalen Treaty, the borders of European state had been irrevocably altered. With a third of the population of Germany dead, even more wounded, the Holy Roman Empire was lethally weakened, but it would take another 200 years for the Napoleonic armies to deliver the coup de grace.

England was hardly spared the calamitous bloodshed of the 17th Century, having kicked off its own civil war and dictatorship under the ultra-puritan Cromwell. But the very fact that the English Civil War was a fight over *control* within a Protestant kingdom, rather than cyclical religious violence at the hands of roving mercenaries, meant that England remained a solvent state (just with new masters). The kingdom of France likewise emerged from Westfalen in a stronger position. The Imperial Bureaucracy had been whipped into shape by the necessities of war, protestant heretics purged, burned, or exiled, and the King's authority was stronger than before. French and English identity had finally cloven into distinct nationalities along linguistic, religious, and political lines.

At this point, we need to discuss the principle of Absolute Monarchy and Enlightened Despotism. The English Civil War began with Protestant burgers in Parliament chopping off their Catholic King's head; the French wouldn't do anything similar until the 1780s. So, when the Monarchy was restored after Cromwell's commonwealth failed, the returning Kings knew not to push their luck. Many of Cromwell's religious and political comrades would choose voluntary exile in North America rather than coexist with a restored monarch, and that's where the US's tradition of evangelical Christianity and it's anti-monarchist streak comes from.

But in France, the King never lost his head and the *causus belli* of the 30 years war was Cardinal Richelieu defending Roman Catholicism from Huguenot heresy. As a result, the absolute authority of the sovereign King was beneficial to the interests of France's political class, especially in the ultra-Catholic holdout of Paris. Louis the Fourteenth (aka the SUN KING -- tells you how much they revered this guy) took the throne in the last few of the 30 Years' War, and he holds the world record for longest-reigning monarch in recorded history (72 years and 110 days). He took over the HRE's role of "catholic defender" because it spat in the face of the Hapsburg Monarchs of Spain and Austria, who also wanted to claim "pope's best friend" as their own title. After Westfalen, the religious violence within France continued unabated (a series of events known as *The Fronde*), and Louis XIV "pacified" the protestant partisans by mercilessly killing those who refused to submit, and taxing the hell out of those who chose to live. The revenues generated from, lets face it, expropriating protestant moneys helped build the Versailles Palace, the site of many future historical watersheds. This guy turned the medieval Kingdom of France into the pre-eminent power in Europe before handing the keys to the car to his descendants -- who lost all of it within two generations. 

There remain two other European Empires that need to be discussed as well: Russia and Spain. These two had managed to vastly expand their territorial holdings and would be vitally important in the Napoleonic wars, but only Russia would emerge with its position improved. Russia, a spin-off of the Kievan Rus culture in present-day Ukraine, was always on the receiving end of Viking attacks, Mongolian invasions, and so-on, and its geographic position vis-à-vis the Baltic meant that Sweden and Denmark determined its terms of trade. That changed under Romanov Dynasty in Muscovy (Present-day Moscow) and their house's greatest scion, Piotr / Пётр / Peter. His plan and dream was to modernise the Tsardom with an infusion of Central European (in particular, French and Prussian) thought and military conquest. He extended Russian power south to the port of Azov on the Black Sea and East across Eurasia. Like Roman Caesar Constantine, he built himself a new modern capital on the Baltic, Petrograd, which would remain the capital of the Russian State until the 1920s. His successor, Ekaterina II aka Catherine the Great, followed his example, developing a doctrine of "enlightened despotism" to legitimate the otherwise backwards social structures of Russian Serfdom.

Spain and Portugal had taken over nearly half of the earth's surface in Latin America, but the wealth extracted wasn't very wisely reinvested. These two empires would begin a rapid decline from their height at the Spanish Armada to begin the political football of the Napoleonic Wars; part of that was the succession question which Britain and France inserted themselves into.
