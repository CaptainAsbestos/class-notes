# What is Politics?

Anthropology, primatology, and archaeology suggest that humans co-existed peacefully in communities that numbered no more than a few hundred people or so. Once that number grows too big, the temptation to form factions in opposition to one another arises inevitably. Why?

Social Contract theorists -- Locke, Rousseau, Hobbes -- speculate on this, but the question goes back centuries. Some say its humanity's sinful nature, others say that this is eternal struggle between ruler and ruled. We'll cover all this later.

Key to the stakes of politics is the economic concept of scarcity. Even in an ideal anarcho-syndicalist commune, the resources available to support families, enterprises, and collective defence vary with the technological capabilities of the day. Perhaps the reason nation-states' populations grew to the size they are is because we have the means to support such larger numbers of people. Conflict arises when those resources become scarce or when members of a political community perceive scarcity. Inequality, the unequal distribution of "desserts," is a type of enforced scarcity, and often coincides with heightening political conflict.

When times are good, or new wealth is discovered (or even taken by force), it is easy to buy the assent of society's stakeholders. In a democracy, the stakeholders are nominally the voting public; in a feudal monarchy, the lords and mercenaries of the realm are the stakeholders. Even in dictatorships, the central leader of a state has to prevent would-be adversaries from subverting or overthrowing him or her. 

It's when the resources are limited that cuts are made, which disadvantage some and privilege others. Desserts may not be just free food or housing; it can be the right to political representation or equality of law. 

Thus, we arrive at Lasswell's definition that politics is "who gets what and how." Nearly everyone in the discipline defines it this way or is familiar with this conceptualisation. But do you agree? Is Lasswell's definition too limited? Why?

# What is a political community?

If we adopt Lasswell's definition, we should consider what he means by "who". Who is part of politics? Who isn't? Why?

To answer the question, I suggest the concept of a "political community." Political communities are the groups of people and institutions who engage in politics with each other and with other communities. They can be as small as families, churches, or clubs; they can be as large as multinational trading blocs or even the United Nations. Those within a community are the ones who "matter", and people who exist outside of that community are governed by different rules. For example, citizens of a country have different civic entitlements and duties than non-citizens who reside within the same borders.

Throughout history, exclusion from a political community is a painful and insulting experience, and several influential political movements focused on redrawing the boundaries of those communities. Palestinians, for example, are a stateless people who are not entitled to legal recourse within the state which controls their lives, Israel. By the same token, anti-colonial independence movements in the Global South wanted to deliberately exclude foreign settlers from political authority (with good reason, in most cases). 

# What is Political Science?

People around the world have been studying and writing about politics since the earliest written records. In this class, we are going to use principles of the scientific method to study the behaviour of political actors. Those include states, political leaders, voters, non-citizens, and institutions. We'll define those in a moment. 

What distinguishes political science from sociology is that we apply sociological methods to a sometimes narrower, sometimes broader subject. We observe the world around us, generate hypotheses to explain what we see, and search for evidence to support our hypotheses. The more evidence we find to support our theories, the more confident we become that these theories accurately describe political behaviour as it exists in reality.

As scientists, we can allow our political beliefs and opinions to guide us in our lives and sometimes our research. But any claim that is unfalsifiable -- impossible to proven wrong -- is not a scientific one, and those aren't so useful for hypothesis generation. Every political theory is guilty of this to some extent, because they all rely on certain fundamental assumptions that may or may not be universally valid. These assumptions, known as postulates in mathematics, are the focus of much debate because they are often mutually incompatible. The fact is, we are nowhere near discovering a "universal grand theory" of politics. And that's not a bad thing!

# Power

What is power? In the physical sense, it's potential energy expended over time. In political science, we think of power in a somewhat similar way. Power is how you get people or things to do something they wouldn't otherwise do. A piece of bread won't turn into toast unless you plug the toaster into the power grid; in politics, other people or groups won't usually alter their behaviour unless power makes them.

There are different types of power, and we could spend all day subdividing them. One is coercion: force, fear, or threat of violence. Another is persuasion: using rhetoric, reasoning, inspiration, or bribery to get people to change their behaviour. There's also information, knowing something that others don't can give you an advantage in manipulating them. 

Power is the currency of politics; you spend it to get things done. Without political power, there's no way to influence the world around you. You might also hear the term "political capital" (spelled with an "a") to refer to basically the same idea. In many ways, the discipline of political science is the study of power. 

At this point, how would you relate Lasswell's definition of politics to the concept of power? 

# Dimensions of Power

Steven Lukes considers three dimensions of power. One is operationalised by Robert Dahl -- the straightforward, "power over someone to make them do XYZ" and observable in instances where those in power get their way more often than those out of power. The second dimension is the power over the "Overton Window," the frame within public discourse takes place. Defining the limits of what is "acceptable" political speech and excluding radical questions is certainly a form of power over others. Lastly, the third dimension is most identifiable with "false consciousness" in the Marxist tradition: the power to make ordinary people believe that serving the interest of the powerful at the expense of the ordinary is worth it. The last two dimensions of power are much harder to observe and operationalise, but they absolutely exist. 


# What is an institution?

Political communities are governed by rules and incentives, but something has to create those rules and enforce those incentives. Those *somethings* are known as institutions, the organs of state and society which encourage some practices and discourage others. A college is an institution because it rewards scholarship; police forces are institutions which discourage breaking the law. Political scientists have developed "rational choice theory" to explain how institutions are able to shape the behaviour of people. When members of a community know that an institution rewards compliance and punishes deviance, it is in their rational self-interest to choose compliance.

In this ways, institutions do not just govern and regulate communities; they actively create them. By way of example, consider public schools and their language of instruction. Schools in the US reward students with high English fluency because only rarely are classes offered in other languages. As a result, immigrant families choose to teach their children English, and thus the school system helps create an Anglophonic population. By contrast, schools in Germany offer class in both German and English, and thus far more Germans are bilingual. 

Down the road, we'll also discuss how institutions change, or how disincentives lose their power. But there's one thing that we should say, which you may already know. The "iron law of institutions" states that once an institution is established, it is very, *very* hard to eliminate it.

# What is the State?

Second in importance to power is "the State," with a capital "S." The State is *the central institution* of political communities. Through the enforcement of laws and collection of taxes, a State amasses the power it needs to governs the life of everyone who resides within its territorial boundaries. And like all institutions, its first priority is guaranteeing its own survival.

Did states always exist? Good question. Maybe long ago, it was possible that humans lived in a stateless existence, and maybe one day we might still. But as long as we have written records, states have existed. Some pin the emergence of the state to the discovery of agriculture. The distribution of land, the regulation of work, and the coordination to defend farmlands from raiders may be possible without a state, but having a central governing institution made it much easier (at least, for the people in charge). The earliest states were brutal and exploitative, relying on slave labour and violence to grow food and defend the produce. It's only recently in human history that slavery was abolished, and some would say that we haven't progressed much farther than slavery at all. More on that later!

# Structural Power \& Foucault

In the Continental school, Foucault is the structural answer to the agency-centric framework from Lukes. To Foucault, power is not merely "power over others;" it can also be stored in institutions and made to instrumentalise humans. Through "discipline" in the training of institutions likes Schools, Hospitals, and Militaries, the human beings staffing an institution become part of the machine which "produces" either knowledge, health, or destruction. (It's self-evident to him that power implies the power to "make" or produce social goods.) Bentham's Panopticon is the ideal representation of how Foucault thinks of power from a structural, rather than agent-centric, perspective: the design of the surveillance system requires minimal exertion from the guards operating it, yet it maximises the potential scrutiny an imprisoned person feels and warps their conduct in ways desired by their captor.

This structural approach to power is much more useful when we consider how unspoken norms govern relations between members of society. Because discipline generates consent to structures of domination, those modes of domination (where visible) become seen as natural, necessary, or even obligatory -- and therefore, acceptable. See how this serves the interests of the powerful? And at the most brutal and inhumane sites of domination, new forms of governance, control, and discipline are innovated. Events like the murder of mentally unwell people in Nazi Germany, the extirpation of Indigenous Americans, \&c. are all the canaries in the coal mine for the rest of us.

# Power \& Moral Imperative

Iris Young combines an agency-centric moral framework with the structural framework: structural *injustice* arises "as a consequence of many individuals and institutions acting in pursuit of their particular goals and interests, within given institutional rules and accepted norms." (Young, 2007: 170) Even though everybody reenforcing the deprivation of a category of people is acting by socially sanctioned norms, these norms and structures are contingent and therefore subject to transformation by humans. Therefore, this deprivation is not just unfortunate, it is unjust. The freedom to exercise power ethically becomes the responsibility to exercise power thus.

We'll see next time how Machiavelli might disagree with this.

# The Levels of Analysis of Political Science

In the political sciences, we typically work with three levels of analysis: individual, institutional (usually states), and systemic. At the individual level, we contemplate how single people make choices and behave. Each one of us can think of our own options available to us politically: voting, if we are citizens, but also striking, joining a political party, \&c. Politicians are often the focus of individual-level analysis, since they exercise more authority through the state.

At the institutional level of analysis, we focus on the interactions and behaviours of institutions. Most often, States themselves are the subject, which is why this is often referred to as "state-level," although plenty of good research is done on sub-state organisations like political parties, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), militaries, etc. Despite being the paramount institution, States rely on various organs to get things done, particularly bureaucracies, legislative coalitions, and economic stakeholders. As a result, states and political leaders constantly seek to maximise their control over their own interior but this is inevitably impossible. Typically, leaders and their selectors (those with the power to remove them) arrive at some kind of bargain, defining the limits of any single office's power within the state.

The third and broadest level is systemic, dealing with political structures and phenomena that are beyond the complete control of any individual state or person. /The United Nations is unusual as it is both an international institution but also not a state. Rather, it is the forum through which sovereign states interact, becoming one kind of system that we can analyse. There's also the global economy, which isn't headquartered in any particular country. World Systems Theory is an entire subfield of political science specialising in the terms of trade between the economic core (Europe and North America) and the periphery where raw resources are extracted (Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America).

# Units of Observation

Every scientist has to be keenly aware of *what* it is that they are studying. When we gather data on our subject and infer conclusions based on that data, what is it that we are observing? This is why we have to be very explicit about our level of analysis.
