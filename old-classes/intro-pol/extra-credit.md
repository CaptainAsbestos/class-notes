# \scshape Extra Credit Assignments

## \textsc{POS-\oldstylenums{2020}}

Each of the following assignments can earn up to extra points of credit against the final overall grade for the course. The due-date for these assignments is the **4th of May, 2023 at 23:59 (midnight)**.

## Option 1: Volunteering

There are many political campaigns, non-governmental organisations, and civil society groups which rely on volunteer labour to function. If you know of an organisation which works in politics and would like to volunteer, let me know so I can sign off on your work. Write a report, **no less than 500 words**, about your experience and how it relates to what we cover in class.

## Option 2: Attend a Guest Lecture

In the nearby of Denver, there are several universities and venues which host guest speakers open to the public, sometimes relating to politics. If you know of such an event, let me know so I can sign off on it. Write a report, no less than 500 words, about the lecture and how it relates to political science.

## Option 3: Who Represents You?

Look up who represents the congressional and state legislative district where you live (Ballotpedia is a good starting point: [https://ballotpedia.org/Main_Page](https://ballotpedia.org/Main_Page), but also check government websites and campaign websites). Find out how long your representative has served, on what committees they work, and what their political goals are. Write a report, no less than 500 words, about these public officials.

## Option 4:

Watch a documentary related to politics, history, or political philosophy. In a report, no less than 500 words, relate the contents of the film to what we discuss in class. Below are documentaries which I have seen and enjoy, but you are welcome to raise suggestions of your own if you wish:

- [Selma: Bridge to Freedom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2slPNFkZyqA) 57 minutes
