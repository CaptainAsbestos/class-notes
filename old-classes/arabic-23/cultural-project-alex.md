# Football in the Arabic World

## Alex & Ousmane

In our project, we will explore the relationship between fans and sport in the Arabic-speaking world. The recent success of Morocco in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar broke new ground for African fans and teams alike. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, likely out of jealousy for Qatar hosting the tournament, is also attempting to attract talent, capital, and attention to its own football scene. By comparison, Egypt's national team is an institution in African Football, having won the CAF cup seven times. Some of the oldest clubs in Africa are also in Egypt, and turmoil at the matches laid the ground for the Arab Spring protests in the 2010s. We will also talk about how widely watched the sport is, which clubs are the most successful, which are the most popular, and so on. Finally, the state of women's football in the region will be discussed.
