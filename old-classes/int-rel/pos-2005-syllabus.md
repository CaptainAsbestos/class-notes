## Executive Summary

This class is designed to acquaint students with the political system of the United States of America and its political culture. We will begin with a brief survey of US history, then move on to examine the Federal System and States, then learn about the civil society of the US. We will critically evaluate ideologies and theories which continue to influence US politics and apply our understanding to current events as they unfold.

### Textbook

Schmidt, Steffen W., Mack C. Shelley, and Barbara A. Bardes. American Government and Politics Today (Brief Edition, \oldstylenums{2022}). United States: Thomson Wadsworth.

## Academic Expectations

### 1. Participation

As an asynchronous delivery course, we will not be meeting in person. Nonetheless, regular participation in the discussion fora on D2L will be part of your final grade. Every week, students are expected to create one discussion thread and comment at least once on other students' threads. Students are encouraged to choose their own topics, which should relate to themes in the textbook, the slides, and the primary sources which we examine. Connecting current events in the news to the discussion fora is also a encouraged. The instructor will post optional prompts every week to generate food for thought.

### 2. Exams

There will be a midterm exam and a final exam, composed of multiple choice and short essay questions. The purpose of these exams is to verify that students can recall material from the readings and reflect critically on it. Both exams will be open book. Each exam may only be taken once.

### 3. Weekly Quizzes

Each week, students are expected to complete an open-book quiz on the course website. There will be two chances to take each quiz, with the higher of the two scores being the recorded grade. If students feel that the answers on the quizzes are incorrect, they are encouraged to inform the instructor for review.

### 4. Written Assignments

Students will be required to submit a précis summarising the contents of a video documentary and to submit a brief research paper on their elected representatives. The papers must be submitted to their appropriate dropboxes on the course website by the specified due date. The Portable Document Format (.pdf) is preferred; otherwise I have no preference for formatting and style. Written assignments will be graded on clarity, accuracy, and critical rigour. 

### 5. Extra Credit

There will be two extra credit assignments in this course, to be announced at a later date. 

### Grade Breakdown:

- Weekly Discussions: (5 points per post + 5 points per reply) x 12 discussions = **120 points** 
- Quizzes: 25 points x 9 quizzes = **225 points**
- Writing Assignments: **40 Points** 
- Midterm Exam: **70 Points**
- Final Exam: **90 Points**
- Extra Credit: Up to **20 Points**

**Total: 545 points**

### Academic Integrity

All work submitted for a grade in this course must be original work begun and completed by each individual student. The [*Student Handbook*](https://www.mtsu.edu/stuaff/PDF/handbook.pdf) prohibits the following forms of academic misconduct:

- **Plagiarism:** the adoption or reproduction of ideas, words, statements, images, or works of another person as one’s own without proper attribution. This includes self-plagiarism, which occurs when an author submits material or research from previous work to satisfy the requirements of another assignment and uses it without proper citation of its reuse. (The best way to avoid accidental plagiarism is to exercise an abundance of caution -- if you're ever unsure, consult with me and we'll make sure you don't run afoul of the rules!)
- **Cheating:** Using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any assignment. This includes unapproved collaboration, which occurs when a student works with others on an academic exercise without the express permission of the professor.
- **Fabrication:** Unauthorized falsification or invention of any information or citation in an academic exercise.
- **Facilitation:** Intentionally and knowingly assisting another student in violating a provision of the institutional code of academic misconduct.
