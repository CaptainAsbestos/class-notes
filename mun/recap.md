# Afghanistan WHO Vaccine Clinic Bombed

## The Guardian, 8th November 2021

\textsc{Kabul} -- A World Health Organisation Polio Vaccine Clinic was bombed in Herat City on Monday afternoon. Today was the first day of a nationwide campaign to eradicate the disease.

According to eye-witnesses, who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, the attackers destroyed two buildings in a rented complex in the Hazara quarter of the city: a warehouse containing polio jabs, refrigerators, protective equipment, and an adjacent residential building housing both WHO workers and local citizens. City authorities have yet to issue a statement about the weapons used, but the size of the blast suggests a suicide car-bombing. The clinic [was a coordinating centre for door-to-door vaccinations](https://news.yahoo.com/nationwide-polio-eradication-campaign-starts-103447119.html), employing both male and female workers. No official number of dead and wounded has been disclosed yet.

No group has come forward to claim responsibility for the attack. In a statement emailed to The Guardian, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid condemned the attack as an act of cowardice. "Vaccine workers were invited to the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan as guests," Mujahid wrote. "The murderers will be hunted down and punished as they deserve."

Polio has resurged among Afghan children since 2018, when fighting intensified in the last years of the decades-long war. The disease, virtually eradicated in Britain, can leave survivors with lifelong paralysis. Still, many regard jabs with suspicion, with health workers accused of being foreign spies or using vaccines to render adults infertile. Afghanistan is one of the last two countries in the world to report cases of polio in children.

# UN Security Council fiddles while WHO Burns

## Russia Today, 14th November 2021

\textsc{Moscow} -- A week has passed since the car bombing of a World Health Organization Polio Vaccine Clinic in Herat City, Afghanistan, with few answers to who is responsible, raising questions about international commitment to the program.

At a press conference last Wednesday in Geneva, WHO press secretary Janina Thuenken answered questions from reporters about the casualties of the attack. "At this time, I can disclose that 6 UN Health workers from France, Canada, and the United Kingdom were killed. The families have asked for privacy in this moment of grief." When pressed for information about Afghan casualties, Thuenken was recalcitrant. "I'm not at liberty to discuss the details of staff security, obviously," she said. "But our teams in country are taking every precaution."

Meanwhile, Afghanistan expert Andrei Tarkovsky, a veteran of the Soviet war in the 1980s, offers an explanation. "The situation is a tricky one," he told RT. "The Taliban values their hard-won sovereignty and would lose face if they consented to foreign security personnel. The Taliban had probably promised protection for foreigners, but they lack either the means or will to guarantee that." 

In other parts of Afghanistan, sectarian fighting has escalated between the burgeoning Islamic State Khorasan Province and local militias loyal in name to the Taliban. ISKP is renowned for its vitriolic hatred toward Shi'a Muslims, who make up the majority of the local population in Herat City. Rumors on Twitter have already suggested them as the likeliest culprits, although the group has not claimed responsibility.

# Kabul bomb attack foiled

## Deutsche Welle, 15th November

### by Silas Herzog

\textsc{Kabul} -- A would-be suicide attack was foiled in Western Kabul early this morning when a car-bomb failed to detonate at a roadblock in Dashte Barchi settlement. The driver and passengers were killed by Taliban militia in a brief exchange of gunfire, who discovered the bombs.

Eye-witnesses told DW reporters that the van attempted to ram the roadblock after shouting was heard. "It was startling," said one man who lives nearby. "I thought it would get much worse."

United Nations security personnel stationed at nearby Watan Hospital had been on high-alert when the shootout began, but were positioned so far away that they could not safely intervene. When reached for comment, Colonel Janusz Kaminski, commander of the forces there, told DW, "Our hands are tied. We have a mandate to protect our own people, but we work at the pleasure of the government. Everyone is lucky the bombs didn't go off."

Dashte Barchi, a majority Hazara-ethnicity settlement, was the site of a 2016 bombing of *Promised Mehdi* Educational Centre which left 34 students dead. The neighbourhood's Shi'ite population makes it a frequent target of Sunni-extremist militias.

# Wikileaks: Links between CIA and ISKP exposed

## Xinhua News Agency, Nov. 15

### by Zhang Yimou

\textsc{Beijing} -- New information published by Wikileaks has unearthed evidence that former US collaborators in the Afghanistan War have defected to the Islamic State in Khorasan Province with the knowledge of CIA handlers.

The documents, from an anonymous source, have been published on the Wikileaks page this morning. This information is even more disturbing in light of the recent declaration that ISKP is responsible for a series of bombings across the war torn nation. The materials indicate interaction between US intelligence handlers and disaffected members of the Afghanistan police and military during the Trump administration. 

After the collapse of the US-backed regime in August of 2021, many agency cultivated assets feared for their lives and joined the only solvent opposition group, the ISKP. The leaked memos show that Langley officials were aware of their contacts going 'underground' and that they were keen to capitalise on new sources of intelligence within the terrorist organisation. The identities of those involved were redacted by Wikileaks, but the contents of the leaks indicate that many had special knowledge of security procedures in large cities as former police officers and militias. 

Since 2004, Wikileaks has published damaging evidence of war crimes and human rights violations committed by US troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. The organisation has come under intense international scrutiny, with the US seeking to extradite chief editor Julian Assange from the United Kingdom to stand trial under the 1917 Espionage Act. The controversial law was first used to persecute American anti-war activists in the First World War and has been used against whistleblowers for over a century.

# Canadian UN ambassador asks for UN Peacekeepers in Afghanistan

## Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, November 16

### by Gord Downey

\textsc{New York} -- At a press conference today, Bob Rae, the Canadian Ambassador to the United Nations, has asked that the Security Council commit to sending Peacekeepers to Afghanistan to protect international aid workers and prevent further sectarian violence in the war-torn country. 

"Canada is grieving for the lives lost in Herat City earlier this week," he told reporters. "Canadian doctors and nurses gave their lives to help others. We should not let their sacrifice go in vain." 

The Herat City bombing and foiled attack in Kabul, both targeting Shi'a Muslim neighbourhoods, have called into question the Taliban's ability to assert influence in a country still divided by ethno-religious grievances. In the aftermath of the calamitous withdrawal of international forces, official Taliban outlets have expressed that the new regime intends to govern on behalf of all Afghans within the limits of Islamic law. 

When pressed by reporters to say whether Canada would recognise the Taliban, Rae demurred. "The question of diplomatic recognition should not prevent us from doing what is needed to protect innocent lives."

# US House of Representatives investigates CIA knowledge of ISKP defections

## Radio France Internationale, November 18

### by Agn√®s Varda

\textsc{Washington, DC} -- The United States House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence are seeking information about CIA knowledge of the terrorist organisation Islamic State Khorasan Province. Documents published by Wikileaks earlier this week demonstrated the agency's awareness that Afghan contacts were defecting, beginning in late 2020. 

Republican Representative Devin Nunes of California criticised the Biden administration for abandoning US allies after the evacuation of 124,000 people in late August. "These men and women -- the people we fought for over 20 years -- have seen their last and only ally abandon them. The president left them behind."

Democratic Representative Adam Schiff of California shared concerns about the CIA's attitude towards the loss of human intelligence contacts to a terrorist organisation. "As leader of the Intelligence committee, I am astounded that the Agency wasn't more forthcoming with this news." 

When asked for comment on the committee's investigation, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki expressed reservations about the veracity of the leaked memos. "[Julian] Assange's organisation has always sought to damage the reputation of America's intelligence community, and these leaks remain unverified and heavily redacted."
