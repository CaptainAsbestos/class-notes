# Afghanistan WHO Vaccine Clinic Bombed

## The Guardian, 8th November 2021

### by Jane Deakins

\textsc{Kabul} -- A World Health Organisation Polio Vaccine Clinic was bombed in Herat City on Monday afternoon. Today was the first day of a nationwide campaign to eradicate the disease.

According to eye-witnesses, who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, the attackers destroyed two buildings in a rented complex in the Hazara quarter of the city: a warehouse containing polio jabs, refrigerators, protective equipment, and an adjacent residential building housing both WHO workers and local citizens. City authorities have yet to issue a statement about the weapons used, but the size of the blast suggests a suicide car-bombing. The clinic [was a coordinating centre for door-to-door vaccinations](https://news.yahoo.com/nationwide-polio-eradication-campaign-starts-103447119.html), employing both male and female workers. No official number of dead and wounded has been disclosed yet.

No group has come forward to claim responsibility for the attack. In a statement emailed to The Guardian, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid condemned the attack as an act of cowardice. "Vaccine workers were invited to the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan as guests," Mujahid wrote. "The murderers will be hunted down and punished as they deserve."

Polio has resurged among Afghan children since 2018, when fighting intensified in the last years of the decades-long war. The disease, virtually eradicated in Britain, can leave survivors with lifelong paralysis. Still, many regard jabs with suspicion, with health workers accused of being foreign spies or using vaccines to render adults infertile. Afghanistan is one of the last two countries in the world to report cases of polio in children.
