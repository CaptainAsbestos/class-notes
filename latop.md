1. Bring a Live USB stick
2. Power up while plugged in, then let it run for 30 minutes on battery. Note the changes.
2. Check system info -- processor, ram, drive, etc

	> lspci

3. check that BIOS is not password protected -- DO NOT BUY IF IT IS PASSWORD PROTECTED, or, MAKE SURE HE GIVES YOU IT. If there's a BIOS password and he doesn't know what it is, then it could be stolen goods and it is not worth the fuss of trying to work around it.
	- Lenovo cannot reset the BIOS aka supervisor password -- losing this will literally brick the board and require a full replacement computer.
	- Ask if there is a hard disk password as well -- ask for it if there is one
	- ask if Power password has been set. this is a pain in the ass but as long as you have the BIOS/Supervisor PW, you'll be ok.
4. WiFi Connectivity
4. Viewing Angle, Brightness, Color Contrast
5. Type a pangram -- the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
6. Check Battery Cycles

	> upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0

7. On Windows 10, run this:

	> start > run > type 'perfmon /report'

8. Ask where it was purchased originally
9. Ask Why he is selling it
10. Ask how much ram is soldered on
11. Ask if the disk is removable
12. Ask if you can pop the hood -- if not, DO NOT BUY

Things that don't add up:

- L14 with the Ryzen 5 Pro 4650U didn't ship with the 128 gb sdd
- And as far as I can tell, the L14 with the 128 gb sdd was never sold in North America
- The 45w power supply was on the Latin American Model -- which has a FHD 1920x1080p screen resolution
