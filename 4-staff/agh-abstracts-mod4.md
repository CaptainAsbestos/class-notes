## Engaging the Nonprofit Workforce

By engagement, the authors mean creating an environment for workers that is satisfying and productive so that worker retention is higher. Unique for the non-profit sector, however, employees don't think of their work as "just another job," but that's no reason to assume they are engaged just because they believe in their organisation's mission.

The advice in the piece is tailored for managers, who are perfectly positioned to foster worker engagement. Most employees want the chance to develop their skills and advance their career, so hiring from within can keep workers engaged with the organisation. 

In keeping with the emotional stake that non-profit workers place in their job, emotional burnout can occur if engagement efforts push too far. Burnout is bad enough on its own terms, but on the practical side it leads to worse performance and *increased* turnover.
