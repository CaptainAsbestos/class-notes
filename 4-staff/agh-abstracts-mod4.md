## Engaging the Nonprofit Workforce

By engagement, the authors mean the extent to which workers feel that the goals and mission of their job align with their own. Engagement is related to but not identical to employment satisfaction. Unique for the non-profit sector, however, employees don't think of their work as "just another job," but that's no reason to assume they are engaged just because they believe in their organisation's mission.

The advice in the piece is tailored for managers, who are perfectly positioned to foster worker engagement. Deliberately centering worker engagement within an organisation's strategic vision is the first step to take. Most employees want the chance to develop their skills and advance their career, so promoting from within can keep workers engaged with the organisation. The expectation for advancement often goes unmet, not least because many NFPs are small and other career opportunities beckon. The authors recommend ongoing training and showing interest in career development of workers. Secondly, hiring workers based on a "cultural fit" can resolve engagement issues before they worsen.

Ass a consequence of the emotional stake that non-profit workers place in their job, emotional burnout can occur if effort put in by employees is met with recognition or reward. Burnout is bad enough on its own terms, but on the practical side it leads to worse performance and *increased* turnover. Many workers in the sector are already at risk of burnout. The authors don't have any material recommendations for this problem aside from acknowledging the difficulty of the work and improving employee engagement in every other way possible.  

Job expectations matter a great deal for worker engagement; specific performance standards and clear explanations for why a task is important helps keep employees from emotionally disengaging from their task. On this front, managers should also receive training on identifying and reducing burnout. Transparency and employee participation helps as well, not just to make workers feel like they are part of the team but to welcome out-of-the-box thinking.

There are demographic variables that affect employee engagement, such as educational level and generational differences, although weakly. The good-ish news is that gender and ethnic diversity have little relationship with reported engagement among workers. 

## Worth, 2014

Worth discusses the work of paid staff and unpaid volunteers in a mixed workforce common to many an NFP. He distinguishes between *policy* and *service* volunteers: the former are involved in leadership and organisational management whereas the latter are involved in implementing operational programs under the supervision of paid managers. 

Worth presents a survey of different management theories, reviewing the theory of scientific-management and other critical theories of management. The current state of research emphasises the importance of human motivations in productivity, although there is no consensus on which needs, expectations, or emotions are most important.
