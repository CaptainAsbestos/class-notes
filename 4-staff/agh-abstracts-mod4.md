## Engaging the Nonprofit Workforce

By engagement, the authors mean creating an environment for workers that is satisfying and productive so that worker retention is higher. Unique for the non-profit sector, however, employees don't think of their work as "just another job," but that's no reason to assume they are engaged just because they believe in their organisation's mission.
