## Engaging the Nonprofit Workforce

By engagement, the authors mean the extent to which workers feel that the goals and mission of their job align with their own. Engagement is related to but not identical to employment satisfaction. Unique for the non-profit sector, however, employees don't think of their work as "just another job," but that's no reason to assume they are engaged just because they believe in their organisation's mission.

The advice in the piece is tailored for managers, who are perfectly positioned to foster worker engagement. Deliberately centering worker engagement within an organisation's strategic vision is the first step to take. Most employees want the chance to develop their skills and advance their career, so promoting from within can keep workers engaged with the organisation. The expectation for advancement often goes unmet, not least because many NFPs are small and other career opportunities beckon. The authors recommend ongoing training and showing interest in career development of workers. Secondly, hiring workers based on a "cultural fit" can resolve engagement issues before they worsen.

Ass a consequence of the emotional stake that non-profit workers place in their job, emotional burnout can occur if effort put in by employees is met with recognition or reward. Burnout is bad enough on its own terms, but on the practical side it leads to worse performance and *increased* turnover. Many workers in the sector are already at risk of burnout. The authors don't have any material recommendations for this problem aside from acknowledging the difficulty of the work and improving employee engagement in every other way possible.  

Job expectations matter a great deal for worker engagement; specific performance standards and clear explanations for why a task is important helps keep employees from emotionally disengaging from their task. On this front, managers should also receive training on identifying and reducing burnout. Transparency and employee participation helps as well, not just to make workers feel like they are part of the team but to welcome out-of-the-box thinking.

There are demographic variables that affect employee engagement, such as educational level and generational differences, although weakly. The good-ish news is that gender and ethnic diversity have little relationship with reported engagement among workers. 

## Worth, 2014

Worth discusses the work of paid staff and unpaid volunteers in a mixed workforce common to many an NFP. He distinguishes between *policy* and *service* volunteers: the former are involved in leadership and organisational management whereas the latter are involved in implementing operational programs under the supervision of paid managers. 

Worth presents a survey of different management theories, reviewing the theory of scientific-management and other critical theories of management. The current state of research emphasises the importance of human motivations in productivity, although there is no consensus on which needs, expectations, or emotions are most important. Each of these theories have strong explanatory strong points for NFP work as well as critical shortcomings. Table 9.1 on page 213 of the text offers a concise summary of widely-examined theories of management, should the reader wish to investigate further. 

Worth spends an entire section applying Denhardt et al.'s theory of human motivation to paid workers. Manager's should be self-aware about their own needs and motivations, because that inevitably rubs off on their interactions with employees and volunteers as well as the workers' motivations as well. Secondly, motivations are not universal, and acknowledging that fact is important, and managers should be realistic about the extent to which the motivations of others can be influenced. Consequently, employees or volunteers who are bad fits might not be worth the effort expended to motivate them successfully. Establishing clear and challenging milestones for achievement can help orient a team around a tangible goal and redirect energy towards a specific end. Rewards for accomplishments may successfully motivate some, but not all, volunteers, and honesty about expected rewards is important to avoid emotional disengagement. Rewards are not limited to wage compensation, but when it comes to that, workers performing the same work should be compensated equally and equitably. Lastly, Denhardt et al. emphasise that the workers in different life-stages are motivated differently and should be supported and managed accordingly. 

On the volunteer side, Worth applies the theories of various authors rather than a single published author. Without volunteers, organisations would have to pay a substantial premium to supplement their work -- not just unskilled work, but also specialised expertise. There is no academic consensus on which particular categorisation of volunteers is best, so real-world organisations should be aware of all of them but consider which typology best fits their organisations volunteer-force. Broadly speaking,one can distinguish volunteers by either the work they do, how often they do it, or why they do it. This last question -- why -- touches on human motivation, which Worth earlier says also relates to the engagement and output of all workers, including volunteers. Research shows that their motivation is similar to that of the paid staff.  

When recruiting volunteers, organisations should first consider *why* volunteers are needed, such as labour supplements or for community engagement; having volunteers with nothing to do is a bad idea. The tasks delegated to volunteers don't have to be low-skill low-importance jobs, but high-importance tasks are best reserved to paid staff. Organisations should also be willing to refuse volunteers if they do not have skills needed to do a job and even target individuals with expert skills for recruitment as a volunteer. Depending on an organisation's structure, a decentralised volunteer program may be preferable to centralised coordination under supervision of a designated volunteer manager. Vacant volunteer positions can also be listed like job listings, rather than waiting for volunteers to show up looking for ways to contribute. As part of risk-management, official volunteer policies can delineate clear boundaries for work and give the organisation legal protection when things go wrong. Affording a sufficient budget to volunteer development can improve the impact of volunteer workers. Lastly, same as with paid staff, setting explicit performance goals and recognising a job well done goes a long way to retaining volunteers.

The NFP sector is growing and volunteer labour is growing with it. Demographic shifts in the future will mean that career volunteer managers will have to handle older volunteers differently than younger ones, same as with paid workers. Making sure that paid staff and volunteers are a diverse group vis-Ã -vis gender, ethnicity, age, and education makes an organisation stronger.
