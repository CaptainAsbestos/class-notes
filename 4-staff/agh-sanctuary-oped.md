# Sanctuary City Op-Ed Nashville

[New reporting from the Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2021/06/17/ice-retaliate-immigrant-advocates-surveillance/) has revealed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement's clandestine surveillance, targeting, and harassing of immigrant rights demonstrators not only in Nashville but throughout the country. The time has come to stop complying with a federal agency that so casually steps outside of its political mandate and resist its efforts to terrorise the most marginalised members of our communities: undocumented migrants.

Nashville's previous policy of non-compliance was reversed by Mayor Cooper; the Tennessee assembly has passed laws prohibiting municipal governments and police departments from non-cooperation. 

Consider the fact that 57% of undocumented people living in the US have been in the country for more than 10 years (according to best estimates). Consider the fact that 56,000 Tennesseean children have an undocumented parent who they depend on, and 150,000 families in the country have an undocumented member. 74% of these families do not own their home, and 70% of them have no health insurance. Rather than a burden on state resources, people without papers and their dependents make do with much less and contribute far surplus value to the economy than they are compensated for: 70% are employed (25% are not seeking employment, leaving only 5% searching for jobs), and they are employed in vital industries such as construction, manufacturing, and agriculture doing tasks that documented residents and full citizens are not willing to do.Undocumented labour generates \$143.4 million in federal tax revenue and yet 29% of undocumented households survive on poverty or sub-poverty incomes.

Non-cooperation with federal customs enforcement is not just good governance, it's also good politics. District attorneys and sheriffs departments around the country, not just in liberal leaning cities, say that undocumented people are more likely to seek police assistance and comply with investigations when they know their immigration status won't be used against them. It also prevents unscrupulous employers from using the threat of an immigration raid to bust unions, which are one of the only options for undocumented people to defend their material interests. 

Federal attorneys and ICE argue that honouring detainers, the request that local police hold an suspected criminal in custody, is necessary for the justice system to function. What they conveniently leave unspoken is that undocumented immigration is not a crime and that detention without a pressing legal warrant (such as from a judge) is unconstitutional.
