# US-Iranian Relations Normalisation: Policy Memo Proposal

PS 3400, Fall \'21

I am interested in the future of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, especially in light of three major developments: the end of the US presence in Afghanistan (and the re-emergence of Salafist extremism there), the rapprochement between Gulf Monarchies and Israel, and the dismal state of the Saudi-American war in Yemen. 

These are all significant shifts in the region which the US has not anticipated or reacted to poorly. The Biden administration is missing a serious opportunity as it plays coy with re-entering the Iran Deal. 

I intend to investigate and consider the possibilities which normal relations in Iran will present for pursuing regional security. I hope to sketch the horizons of the common interests which the two countries might build on, particularly environmental policy. Vaccine exports to Iran to alleviate the pandemic burden is ideal as a starting point for goodwill gestures and returns to the JCPOA. 

Relevant in particular to this course will be a close examination of restarting the JCPOA's inter-governmental inspections regime and the efficacy of economic sanctions at changing Iranian behaviour.
