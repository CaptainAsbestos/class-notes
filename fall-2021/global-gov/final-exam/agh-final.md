### I: Ethics \& Political Science Research

\sf All the sciences face ethical dilemmata when conducting research because what we discover can be used by humans for good or ill. Methodologically, sensitive data on people should be kept as anonymous as possible, not just to protect them reprisals or public shame but also because it improves the richness of the data. Social scientists should always be wary that the findings or data could be used in unexpected or unethical ways. For instance, theories about counter-insurgency strategies may find their way into practice by militaries; if the science is flawed and the conclusions drawn from it are unsubstantiated, policies based on it may do little to curb violence or (worse yet) intensify retaliation. Lastly, researchers need to be aware of their own role in observing human societies, especially because there's an obvious power imbalance from communities being observed and the researcher benefiting from their cooperation. How much do the subjects of the experiment stand to gain compared to the resum√©-padding of a thesis researcher? If people are in obvious need of humanitarian assistance, is it ethical to insist on rigid protocols preventing researchers from interfering (ie helping)? And that's before one even considers the repercussions of interference to the community being studied. Best practices of social science research should be prepared in advanced and submitted to institutional review before research begins, but that doesn't mean that researchers are off the hook once their proposals pass. Ethics is a practice, not a discussion: researchers should always be asking themselves, "is this ethical" at every step along the way. 

### II: The Prisoner's Dilemma

This thought experiment is a classic of game theory. It explains why, in an iterative game, players with strong incentives to betray one another can learn to cooperate. While the prisoner's dilemma explains a great deal, there are plenty of reasons to believe that international relations are not so simple as a game theory would predict. To extend the metaphor, one might ask why states are in "prison" in the first place, and whether these game theoretic models apply to countries with gross power imbalances (even during peer-competition in the Cold War, the US and Soviet Union were not equal adversaries). It also centres the state as the primary actor in international relations, which may miss other levels of analysis at the sub-state level such as multinational corporations or domestic social movements. 

### III: Validity \& Generalisation

Constructing a valid hypothesis is necessary to answer a research question with any degree of confidence. Validity can be broken down into four components, as Bhattacherjee writes: internal, external, construct, and statistical. Causal relationships in appropriate time order are internally valid (ie, non-spurious correlation); external validity is generalisability (more on that later); construct validity arises from how well we can measure a phenomenon and draw conclusions from it (in other words, confidence); statistical validity requires that we are using the appropriate methods to analyse data and that our sample size is large enough. Not all of these "validities" are relevant in all research designs, but they offer a framework for testing and retesting hypotheses by manipulating independent variables, randomizing data, including known correlates in an analysis, and recording variation between test populations and control populations. 

Generalisation is important in a utilitarian sense: if the findings of scientific research don't apply to other cases, then it isn't a particularly useful or interesting finding. This isn't to say that we should draw general conclusions from unique cases or vice versa. Rather, by retesting a theory in new ways and with new data, we can help refine it by whittling it down to that which is evidence can't dispute. 

### IV: Security Definitions

International Relations Theory came of age in the 20th century as a spin-off of National Security studies. The consequence of this fact can't be understated: the default position of the discipline has historically been that the state itself is the referent of security concerns. This isn't necessarily a normative proposition, but it means that alternative referents of security policy can be marginalised, particularly human security, which prioritises the well-being of individual humans.

The implications of a human security paradigm are quite far-reaching. Should economic welfare be considered a security question? If so, what tools are at our disposal to address problems like poverty? And who is the "we" that is expected to act -- is it still the state authorities, or is it community groups or other human beings? What are the dangers of securitising human welfare, given the mixed record of "securitising" international relations more broadly? Another question would be which referent best secures the other -- do safe humans make safe states, or vice versa?

## Long Essays

### I: Globalisation

Steger argues that globalisation is a group of socio-economic processes which are changing social conditions around the world. (Steger, *Ideologies of Globalisation*, 2005. 13.) He defines it in opposition to others who describe it as a condition -- *globality* is his preferred term for the end state envisioned by proponents of the process. The ideologies of *globalism* arises from the process itself, which make a series of claims to justify and reify the process. Importantly, globalisation erodes the basic economic sovereignty of national economies, and this erosion manifests differently depending on a country's station in the world order. Theoretically, states dependent on one another for trade will not seek war against each other.

Globalisation as we are currently experiencing may seem novel, but the world has in fact experienced phases of globalisation and many periods of globality just as sophisticated as ours. The expansion of mercantilist empires into the New World, Africa, and Asia was one such phase; before them were globalised trading routes through the Mongolian and Islamic Empires, and before them was the Mediterranean empires of antiquity. So first, we ought to dismiss that globalisation is an "end of history" or the inevitable and stable telos of civilisation. Globality did not last forever, and there is no reason to conclude our own period will either. Second, periods of globalisation are historically linked to expansions of trade through bloody conquest and pillage sent back to the imperial core. Treasure flows in from the frontiers and coercion flows back out: the hardest, least desirable work is forced upon people with the least means to resist. This much remains quite true for our modern phase, where the West commands a central role in the world system and profits off the wealth extraction from the workers of poorer countries. Rising economic tides create opportunities for some to rise and others to fall (in broad historic terms, you might see the Sino-Soviet split as one such example), but the inequalities between poorest and richest grow wider and wider. (Sassen, *Globalisation or Denationalisation?*, 2003. 6.)

Once a state of partial globality is realised, new contradictions emerge from the system. To continue the tide metaphor, the capitalist engine driving globalisation still runs on oil, and carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere will literally raise the tides. This is written off as an unpriced externality -- the harm cause will not be assessed in dollar values and will not fall on everyone's heads equally. Other unintended negatives brought about by globalisation was the rise of non-state actors as security threats, since they use the same channels established by common customs and immigration zones, international finance, communications technology, and so on to carry out their activities without the backing of states. Economic catastrophes in one region of the world now have the possibility of spilling over into other regions, such as the Austrian Stock Crash of 1873 triggering the *first* Great Depression in the US or the modern Greek debt crisis threatening the solvency of the European monetary system.

Some would argue that the spread of democracy always follows the ascendancy of the bourgeoisie, and that globalisation will create that global bourgeoisie. Slaughter made this point (Slaughter, *Everyday Global Governance*, 2003.), highlighting how transnational networks of subnational leaders handle global crises through established channels. This kind of coordination would be unlikely in a system of sovereigns jealously guarding their own resources and capabilities. And yet, the emergence of an economic bourgeoisie in many authoritarian states has been facilitated by the government, so rather than opposing their rulers, the middle class is bought off. Indeed, from a strictly economic point of view, authoritarian states with mixed-market economies are *great* for international business.

Slaughter argues in 2021 that global governance networks were instrumental in limiting the worst excesses of an authoritarian backslide within major world democracies and remain vital in the fight against Coronavirus. But the pandemic has once again revealed how regional catastrophes can metastasise around the world in a globalised system: demand collapse and supply chain disruption are not symptoms of a respiratory illness, but of a fragile system which prioritises profits over human welfare. And so far, none of these transnational governmental networks seem able or willing to reinvent the world order to avoid another disruption: the contradictions remain unpriced as *externalities* and they become *normalised.*

## II: International Law

As international law is merely law "between" rather than "over" sovereigns, reciprocal enforcement is the ultimate (as in last) guarantor of compliance. But along the escalating path of reprisals there are other measures to induce or coerce states into compliance.

In a game theoretic sense, interaction between sovereign states is an iterative game, meaning that trustworthiness can be an asset to get ahead. Axelrod and Hamilton demonstrated with computer simulation how an actor employing a reflexive tit-for-tat strategy can infiltrate an asocial environment, induce others to adopt a strategy identical to cooperation, and resist intrusion by bad actors (Axelrod & Hamilton *The Evolution of Cooperation*, 1981. 1393.). But this level of analysis only applies to inter-sovereign relations, while modern international law now stretches deep into domestic political questions such as respect for human rights, environmental protection, and financial affairs. Clearly, something more than game theory is needed to explain compliance.

Reputation is one independent variable whose relationship to legal compliance political scientists have scrutinised well. While naming and shaming is a widely used strategy to penalise non-compliant regimes, it is first required that violations be detected (not always possible); second, polities may calculate reputation costs for unexpected audiences. On economic matters, Simmons found that market forces were a likely candidate for compliance with international law because states could signal to interested parties (firms and banks) that they would behave predictably and responsibly (Simmons, *Commitment and Compliance in International Monetary Affairs*, 2000.). 

Koh tackles the enforcement question by synthesising the work of Chayes, Chayes, and Franck. He argues that compliance arises from a process of transnational *internalisation* of legal norms. It starts with *interaction* between sovereigns which create treaties and customs of behaviour; these permeate into national discourses by *interpretation*; finally, international law is *integrated* into domestic legal systems and carries weight of state-enforcement. (Koh, *Why Do Nations Obey International Law*, 1997. 2602.) Koh is less concerned with what variables influence compliance outcomes. 

International law is useful to states as a way of regulating an anarchic environment where life and death stakes threaten their very survival. Covenants offer predictability when states have imperfect information by tying signatories to commitments and penalties in advance. Thus, customs and law can legitimise the actions states take with or against each other. However, since enforcement depends on sovereign states taking action, it is difficult to coerce the most powerful states to obey the same rules, even with the widespread adoption of norms and customs. Paradoxically, enforcing the rules on a rogue sovereign *relies on* the power of sovereign states. 

Another consequence of the reliance on sovereign power is that for a long time, private citizens had no standing in international law. There existed merchant law, citizenship law, and so on since the dawn of modernity, but all of these were underwritten by state interest in the outcome of a case. Even after the Second World War, which saw the international community finally take human rights more seriously, the International Court of Justice in the UN System only hears cases where *states* are disputants and its jurisdiction is only rarely universal and automatic.
