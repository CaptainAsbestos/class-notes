# UN Security Council Inaction on WHO Bombing

## Russia Today, 14th November 2021

### by Sergei Bondarchuk

\textsc{Moscow} -- A week has passed since the car bombing of a World Health Organization Polio Vaccine Clinic in Herat City, Afghanistan, with few answers to who is responsible, raising questions about international commitment to the program.

At a press conference last Wednesday in Geneva, WHO press secretary Janina Thuenken answered questions from reporters about the casualties of the attack. "At this time, I can disclose that 6 UN Health workers from France, Canada, and the United Kingdom were killed. The families have asked for privacy in this moment of grief." When pressed for information about Afghan casualties, Thuenken was recalcitrant. "I'm not at liberty to discuss the details of staff security, obviously," she said. "But our teams in country are taking every precaution."

Meanwhile, Afghanistan expert Andrei Tarkovsky, a veteran of the Soviet war in the 1980s, offers an explanation. "The situation is a tricky one," he told RT. "The Taliban values their hard-won sovereignty and would lose face if they consented to foreign security personnel. The Taliban had probably promised protection for foreigners, but they lack either the means or will to guarantee that." 

In other parts of Afghanistan, sectarian fighting has escalated between the burgeoning Islamic State Khorasan Province and local militias loyal in name to the Taliban. ISKP is renowned for its vitriolic hatred toward Shi'a Muslims, who make up the majority of the local population in Herat City. Rumors on Twitter have already suggested them as the likeliest culprits, although the group has not claimed responsibility.
