## Question 1: Core Args

States are primary actors, acting rationally, state leaders are rational in their choices. 

International order is a hierarchy, under the leadership of a dominant power. Rules governing the intl politcall system are like a domestic hierarchy.

Internal growth and development is the primary source of international change. 

Alliance ties between states are relatively inflexible (but this is a contested assumption)

As a result, PTT predicts that when a dissatisfied state has the capabilities to revise the status quo and effectively challenge the dominant, then war between great powers will break out. 

## Question 2: Research w/in Realism

Because it throws out the fundamental realist assumption that the international system is characterised by anarchy, Alexander argues that it is not a realist research programme. The counter argument, from Brian and Nazim, is that hierarchy is just a state pursuing power as its own end within a realist paradigm, and therefore compatible with the realist presumption of international anarchy. 

Secondly, Alexander thinks it's distinct because challengers have different attributes from dominant states, and the source of international conflict emerges from within the leadership-constituencies of states rather than the structure of the international system itself.

There's also a difference between power parity and the balance of power. Balance of power theories leads one to predict peace between a great power states as long as their capabilities are matched, whereas PTT predicts that matched capabilities between adversaries will lead to war. 

## Q3: Empirical Contributions

PTT researchers have investigated the question of whether and what kind of states engage in preventive war, Lemke finding that preventive war is not supported. They have also investigated the conflict spiral vs deterrence model of war onset, finding that deterrence breakdowns predict outbreak of war more often. Last, they have also provided an interesting theoretical model of the international system as overlapping hierarchies between force dyads. 

## Q4: Relevance

PTT has a compelling theoretical basis, so we believe that it remains relevant today. Since there are multiple "off-roads" from conflict between a hegemon and a revisionist, the Sino-American Relationship will be a great test case; the Russia-Ukraine war is also an great case to apply the theory to, either looking at the RF as the major power vis a vis ukr or the minor power within the grand intl system. However, Alexander wonders how climate change will affect the research programme. Another example would be the Iran JCPOA, with the US choosing to interfere with Iran's ability to achieve nuclear parity at the edge of the US's sphere of influence.

In conclusion, it would be premature to dismiss PTT as a degnerative research programme.
