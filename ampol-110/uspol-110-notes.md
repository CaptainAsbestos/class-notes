# The Judicial Branch

## Organisation, Basic Function, Opinion, Appointments, Nature of Decision-Making

25 October

## Legitimacy

- legitimacy rests on symbolic acceptance of their opinions by the other players in the system
- referees considered "above politics"
- Symbolic trappings 
    * Lady justice is blind, holding scales to judge fairness and sword to execute justice swift and final
    * the judges where robes, a holdover from the era where the church were the highest judicial authority. now it's more like a quasi-religious reverence for rule-of-law
    * the supreme court is intentionally distant and inaccessible to create the impression that they are apolitical

> *The judiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over either the sword or the purse; no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society; and can take no active resolution whatever. It may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.* – Federalist \#78, by Hamilton

- Justices neither enforce the law nor write it, they interpret it
- Despite the claim that the court is apolitical, the easiest way to predict the outcome of a supreme court decision is to look at the ideology of the judges.
    * ideology: defined as how you reconcile what you want with what you believe. an abstract, organised, and comprehensive set of political values and plan for change

## History of the Judiciary 

- Historically, the court is highly regarded among the three branches of the federal state
- between parties, it has become less popular among democrats after the dobbs decision in 2022
- Dissents used to not be published because it revealed the politicking in the court itself
- Historically, the court sought unanimous consensus 

## Organisation of the Courts

- Federalism: it is organised with hierarchical spheres of jurisdiction (municipal/state/federal)
    * This is b/c each state has its own system of laws and unique court structure (Louisiana, for instance, still uses the Franco-Roman legal tradition)
    * Most cases are decided at municipal level, most appeals never get past state courts
    * Federal courts deal with *federal* law – disputes between states, between citizens and states, between states and federal government. ie Constitutional questions
    * Errors: higher courts can review the outcomes of cases from lower on the ladder if one side can argue that a mistake has been made.
- Further up the ladder you go, the more judges there are on each panel

## Function \& Operation

9 Justices decide precedents which guide lower courts for the future

- SCotUS is the final court of appeal; the only thing which can reverse a SCotUS decision is another SCotUS decision
    * example: *Brown v. Board* reversed *Plessy*
- Generally speaking, justices avoid offering sweeping judgements or writing legislation from the bench; they prefer to decide on a case-by-case basis (this is why selective incorporation is a *selective* doctrine)
- **TEST QUESTION**: Is the current court more conservative or liberal?
- **TEST QUESTION** Who is the current chief justice of the SCotUS?
    * Look up John Roberts and institutionalism
- SCotUS chooses which questions it wants to consider – at least *four justices* have to take an interest in a case 
- How do you change the ideological makeup of the course? your side will need:
    * control of the presidency
    * control of the senate
    * influence in law schools 
    * successful grooming of new judges in state and district courts
    * an opening on the bench (death or retirement)
- Decisions are accompanied with a written opinion, which explains the legal reasoning for why the authors or co-signers arrived at their ruling
    * Majority: 5 of 9 minimum
    * Concurring: Justices who agree with majority but they want to elaborate on different reasons why they agree
    * Dissenting: Justices who disagree with the majority and explain why. Some dissents have become the basis for future reversal in precedent (like the dissent from *Plessy* becoming the unanimous opinion in *Brown*)

# Public Opinion \& the Media

## Nov 6

Government "by the people" -- but what do the people want? Which people matter? 

Public opinion depends on the issue, knowledge about that issue, proximity to the issue, and social and political groups interested in that issue.

Public opinion is always changing, with great variation on intensity of beliefs and salience of the issue.

The more discrete your tools for measuring public opinion are, the better the quality of information you get. Break down by party ID, social class, intensity/salience

Public opinion polls draw a randomly-selected sample from the target population; a statistically representative size is ~1500-3000 people. With random sampling, the sample should resemble the target population. But you can study all 18+ Americans, all registered voters, all likely voters, all likely voters in a swing state, or all likely voters in a swing state with a telephone. We make inferences based on these samples but there is always a margin of error which reduces our confidence in whatever conclusions we draw. The error margin is where we can confidently say the margin lies

Ultimately, elections themselves are the ultimate poll -- everything else is just weather forecasting

## What influences public opinion responses?

- Question wording can prime certain responses
- Answer options: multiple choice or open ended? 
- Question order: earlier questions stir people's thinking and get them to change their minds about later ones

We've discovered this through scientific experiments

# Political Socialisation (November 8)

How do people acquire their political beliefs?

First and most important influence: *Family*. Generally speaking, most people acquire their parents' Party ID, especially if both parents have the same Party ID. But where there are differences, people usually acquire their *mother's*.

Second, income. People tend to live in areas of houses worth near the same value, ie people who can afford to live there. Income determines schooling opportunities, social circles, and neighbours. 

Third, education. K-12 schooling is designed to inculcate civic values approved by the State in impressionable children. At the college level, the more post-high school education you have, the more liberal you are likely to be (generally speaking). This is because the self-reenforcing feedback loops of local culture are not there; you meet people from all over the place. This is known as cosmopolitanism.

Fourth, historic events which affect everyone in society. For Gen Z, it's CoViD-19; for Millennials, 9/11 and the Housing Crash; for Gen Xers, it's the fall of communism, for Boomers, it's Vietnam/watergate/civil rights movement. Be cautious tho, because it's easy to overstate the importance of generational experience. Also, not everyone in a generational cohort experiences the same events as intensely or reacts to events the same way.

## Causal analysis of politics

As political scientists, we want to explain what we see in the world. What causes human behaviour?

Two types of causal attributions:

1. Situational / Environmental: causes are outside the individual
2. Dispositional / Individual: causes come from within the individual

Example: what makes someone wealthy? A situational cause would say that the environment they grow up in (family connections, luck, gender) leads to their success, whereas dispositional causes say that individual talent and hard work leads to success.

To follow this example, most Americans believe that individual attributes cause success. But breaking this down by ideology, libs clearly attribute success to environmental causes, while cons attribute it to individual causes. It gets complicated because, generally speaking, wealth correlates with ideology -- the richer you are, the more likely you are to believe your success was a result of your innate ambition, grit, and talent, not on environmental conditions.

Joslyn also applied this approach to the flipside: what do Americans think causes poverty? Is it dispositional or environmental? Research shows that most Americans attribute poverty to individual choices (ie, a dispositional cause), and not discrimination, lack of education, \&c. (situational cause). Break this down by ideology, and libs believe more in environmental causes while cons believe more in individual causes.

You could also break down public opinion by other variables, such as age. See what the difference in opinion between generational cohorts

If you want to change public policy in a democracy, you change public opinion. If you want to change public opinion, you have to make people reassess the causes which they attribute to social problems.
