## McManus, 2011

McManus begins by asking what kind of fundraising activites work best with competing financial interests: long-term sustainability, so-called "bang-for-buck," and expanding the revenue base. In the US, charitable donations amount to several hundred billion dollars, but because there are so many non-profits using funds, it can feel as if NFPs and NGOs compete for the same scarce resources to continue their work.

Professionals distinguish between fund-*raising* and fund-*development*: the latter is an iterative process that involves "making the ask" as merely one step in a series of steps. This shift of perspective allows planners to think strategically and to anticipate the difficulties of the process. McManus's thesis is that "good fundraising flows out of the principles of strategic fund development."
