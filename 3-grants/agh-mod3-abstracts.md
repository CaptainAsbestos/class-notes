## McManus, 2011

McManus begins by asking what kind of fundraising activites work best with competing financial interests: long-term sustainability, so-called "bang-for-buck," and expanding the revenue base. In the US, charitable donations amount to several hundred billion dollars, but because there are so many non-profits using funds, it can feel as if NFPs and NGOs compete for the same scarce resources to continue their work.

Professionals distinguish between fund-*raising* and fund-*development*: the latter is an iterative process that involves "making the ask" as merely one step in a series of steps. This shift of perspective allows planners to think strategically and to anticipate the difficulties of the process.

McManus's thesis is that "good fundraising flows out of the principles of strategic fund development." She relates an anecdote about her first fund-raising job, describing six key lessons she wishes she had known. First, people are more likely to donate when they sense a genuine human on the receiving end. Second, the Pareto Principle applies to donors and raised revenue. Third, pursuing visibly wealthy sources of funds often means one looks over less obvious opportunities. Fourth, the relationship between giver and recipient matters more than the money being given. Fifth, fund-raising doesn't happen in a vacuum, which means that it has to be operationally plugged into all other activity and aware of other operations. Lastly, she says that proudly giving philanthropists (big or small) a chance to participate is always better than humbly begging for a contribution. 

Fund-development is not a one-size fits all strategy; different groups will find success with different models. McManus lists the various types of contributions that can come, broadly categorised into annual gifts and major gifts.

Were she to redo her first job as a NFP fundraiser, she would begin by first understanding who the organisation is and why they wanted funds from what kind of donor. Then, she would acquaint herself with the organisation's work and mission so that she could present an informed recommendation to the governing board. Next, she would identify the likeliest candidates for contribution and only send letters to arrange a face-to-face meeting for the "ask." 

The final section is a "Dos & Don'ts" of fund-development. Flowing from her belief that everyone should be proud of their work, she reiterates that fund-raisers offer a chance for philanthropy to their donors (transactional, yes, but it works better than mealy-mouthed begging). It's also important to honour your donor's time and intelligence by being straightforward and making intelligent asks. Lastly, fund diversification should always be part of an NFP's overall strategic considerations.
