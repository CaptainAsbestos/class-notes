### PS 5275 NGOs & Non-Profits
#### 21 May, 2021

##### Powerpoint Slides

The presentation prepared by the NCCS describes the varied nonprofit sector in the US. Most are involved in humanitarian purposes, although the largest category of "human services" might include non-humanitarian endeavours. Nonprofits contribute a non-insignificant amount to annual GDP and employ millions -- it's not a small sector by any measure.

The operation of a non-profit scales up dramatically as the organisation scales up in size; revenue comes from service fees, either from government or private sources, from private donations, and public grants. With public funding comes the expectation of transparency, accountability, and meaningful results. Volunteers supplement the work of paid professionals.

##### 8 Characteristics of Nonprofit Organizations

The authors identify eight distinct characteristics of non-profits in the hope of helping outsiders better understand how best to work with them. Because non-profits are not just any other job, people working and volunteering their time for them don't necessarily behave 'realistically' compared to workers in the normal private sector. Furthermore, they face a different array of challenges and obstacles to overcome, both in human resources and what they are expected to accomplish.
