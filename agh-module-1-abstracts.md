### PS 5275 NGOs & Non-Profits

##### Powerpoint Slides

The presentation prepared by the NCCS describes the varied nonprofit sector in the US. Most are involved in humanitarian purposes, although the largest category of "human services" might include non-humanitarian endeavours. Nonprofits contribute a non-insignificant amount to annual GDP and employ millions -- it's not a small sector by any measure.

The operation of a non-profit scales up dramatically as the organisation scales up in size; revenue comes from service fees, either from government or private sources, from private donations, and public grants. With public funding comes the expectation of transparency, accountability, and meaningful results. Volunteers supplement the work of paid professionals.

##### 8 Characteristics of Nonprofit Organizations

The authors identify eight distinct characteristics of non-profits in the hope of helping outsiders better understand how best to work with them. Because non-profits are not just any other job, people working and volunteering their time for them don't necessarily behave 'realistically' compared to workers in the normal private sector. Furthermore, they face a different array of challenges and obstacles to overcome, both in human resources and what they are expected to accomplish.

##### Distinctive Contributions of INGOs

International NGOs leverage their transnational networks to fill niche roles that domestic NGOs cannot. They excel at consciousness-raising in the Global North, both to make the public aware of problems abroad and to mobilise governments to act. With a foot in the field and another in the political sphere, they pass experience and know-how on to policy-makers from practitioners.

The short-term donation-funding model of INGOs stands at odds with the requirements of long-lasting change; most are constantly seeking funding just to keep the lights on. In military conflict zones, their mission cannot realistically remain apolitical. INGOs often do not coordinate well with one another, even if they oversee transnational action networks of their own. As TANs, INGOs can sometimes slip into the role of a patron to smaller NGOs rather than an mission organisation in its own right, which undermines "downward" accountabiltiy as "upward" accountability (ie, keeping up appearances in the Global North) is prioritised. Lastly, INGOs encounter hostility from many of the same people they are trying to help *precisely because* they are international. Some of this hostility is justified -- obviously, nobody wants foreigners meddling in their country's affairs -- but the lack of accountability of well-endowed INGOs which rely on powerful First World governments for grants is one area where INGOs must acknowledge and work to improve their public standing.
