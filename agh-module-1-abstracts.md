### Powerpoint Slides

The presentation prepared by the NCCS describes the varied nonprofit sector in the US. Most are involved in humanitarian purposes, although the largest category of "human services" might include non-humanitarian endeavours. Nonprofits contribute a non-insignificant amount to annual GDP and employ millions -- it's not a small sector by any measure.

The operation of a non-profit scales up dramatically as the organisation scales up in size; revenue comes from service fees, either from government or private sources, from private donations, and public grants. With public funding comes the expectation of transparency, accountability, and meaningful results. Volunteers supplement the work of paid professionals.

### 8 Characteristics of Nonprofit Organizations

The authors identify eight distinct characteristics of non-profits in the hope of helping outsiders better understand how best to work with them. Because non-profits are not just any other job, people working and volunteering their time for them don't necessarily behave 'realistically' compared to workers in the normal private sector. Furthermore, they face a different array of challenges and obstacles to overcome, both in human resources and what they are expected to accomplish.

### Distinctive Contributions of INGOs

International NGOs leverage their transnational networks to fill niche roles that domestic NGOs cannot. They excel at consciousness-raising in the Global North, both to make the public aware of problems abroad and to mobilise governments to act. With a foot in the field and another in the political sphere, they pass experience and know-how on to policy-makers from practitioners.

The short-term donation-funding model of INGOs stands at odds with the requirements of long-lasting change; most are constantly seeking funding just to keep the lights on. In military conflict zones, their mission cannot realistically remain apolitical. INGOs often do not coordinate well with one another, even if they oversee transnational action networks of their own. As TANs, INGOs can sometimes slip into the role of a patron to smaller NGOs rather than an mission organisation in its own right, which undermines "downward" accountabiltiy as "upward" accountability (ie, keeping up appearances in the Global North) is prioritised. Lastly, INGOs encounter hostility from many of the same people they are trying to help *precisely because* they are international. Some of this hostility is justified -- obviously, nobody wants foreigners meddling in their country's affairs -- but the lack of accountability of well-endowed INGOs which rely on powerful First World governments for grants is one area where INGOs must acknowledge and work to improve their public standing.

### Global Civil Society

The chapter charts illustrate many of the points made in the NCCS slideshow brought up. Non-profits should not be written off as part of the global economy in terms of production, employment, or finance. This is no doubt because Nonprofits supplement the failure of states at providing basic human welfare services to their populations -- not just in the global south, but in industrialised nations as well. They operate worldwide in many diverse fields, and the trend over time has been the "de-Americanisation" of NGOs. Nonprofits generate their revenue primarily through fees and public support rather than philanthropic donations, although some country's non-profit sectors skew more towards public grants than others. For volunteer-centric non-profits, philanthropy accounts for much more revenue. In the '90s, the non-profit sector's employment grew faster than the overall economy, mostly in health and social services.

I can't help but notice how all of this coincides with the neoliberal turn -- and how, shockingly, private charity of the wealthy was never as important as transactional fees or public support to keep non-profits running.

### Worth - Overview of the Non Profit Sector

Beginning with a survey of the Non-profits present in DC, it becomes immediately clear that the line between non-profit and for-profit is difficult to discern; both are closely entangled with one another, the state, private philanthropy, and customers.
